# Verified publishers

A verified publisher is an extension publisher who has verified ownership of a domain associated with their brand or identity. For example, the publisher "Contoso" can verify ownership of the domain contoso.com, the landing page for their brand.

## Verified publisher benefits

Verifying your publisher comes with the following benefits:

* Extension consumers can confirm the authenticity of your publisher by viewing your verified domain.
* The verified publisher badge is prominently displayed next to your publisher display name on marketplace.visualstudio.com and VS Code.
* You can protect your publisher from name-squatting or other impersonation tactics.
* Extension consumers can easily access your brand's landing page or your professional portfolio to learn more about you and improve confidence when viewing your extension.

## Verification criteria

Verification is open to any extension publisher, enterprise to individual, with an eligible domain to verify.

Eligible domains must meet the following criteria:
	• Cannot be a subdomain (i.e. <subdomain>.github.io, <subdomain>.azurewebsites.com, <subdomain>.contoso.com or similar).
	• You must be able to manage the DNS configuration settings and add a TXT record.
	• Your domain must use HTTPS protocol.
	• Your domain URL cannot return a 404 error.

We recommend choosing the domain that best supports your publisher's authenticity and credibility. For organizations, that will likely be your brand's primary domain or landing page (i.e. "microsoft.com"). For individuals, it may be your professional or project website.
