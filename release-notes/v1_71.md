# August 2022 (version 1.71)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the August 1.71 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the August milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22August+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### FFmpeg codecs support

FFmpeg shared library shipped as part of the application previously had only support for `FLAC` codec, with `1.71` the library has been updated to support the following list of codecs and containers. This will allow more audio and video files to be played from Notebooks or by extensions embedding audio and video in webviews.

* Vorbis
* Flac
* H.264
* VP8
* WAV
* MP3
* Ogg

### Explorer rename selection improvements

After initiating a rename action on a file, pressing the <kb>F2</kb> key will cycle through the file name, entire selection, and file extension to allow for more flexible keyboard only iteraction.

## Editor

### Configure suggest matching

A new setting allows to configure IntelliSense filtering. By default the first character must match a word start, e.g `c` must match `console` or `WebContext` but won't match `description`. The `editor.suggest.matchOnWordStartOnly`-setting allows to change this. When disabled filtering takes any match into account - this leads to more results but filtering still happens by match quality.

### Sticky Scroll

Sticky scroll is a feature that shows the current scope at the top of the view port. It is no longer experimental and can be enabled through the setttings with `editor.stickyScroll.enable`. The changes made are:

* It is possible to choose the maximum number of lines to display
* It is possible to control/command click in the sticky scroll, taking one to the definition(s)

## Terminal

### Shell integration improvements

The following improvements to shell integration were made this release:

* Fish shell integration is available as an experimental manual install only. [See the docs for how to install it.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_manual-installation)
* Git bash for Windows shell integration is available as an experimental manual install only. [See the docs for how to install it.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_manual-installation)
* Support for common alternative current working directory sequences: `OSC 6 ; scheme://<cwd> ST`, `OSC 1337 ; CurrentDir=<cwd> ST`, `OSC 9 ; 9 ; <cwd> ST`
* [Better handling of various edge cases](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+assignee%3ATyriar+milestone%3A%22August+2022%22+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aterminal-shell-integration+label%3Abug)

### Smooth scrolling

The terminal now supports smooth scrolling which will animate scrolling over a short period to help orient yourself after scrolling, like the feature that is also available in the editor and lists. To enable it set:

```json
"terminal.integrated.smoothScrolling": true
```

### Underline styles and colors

Underline styles and colors are now supported using the escape sequences [originally pioneered by the kitty terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/underlines/). For supporting programs these new underlines should light up automatically, provided they send these sequences to the VS Code terminal.

![The terminal can now display straight, double, curly, dotted and dashed underlines in any color](images/1_71/terminal-underlines.png)

Included in this is improved underline rendering when GPU acceleration is enabled which avoids glyphs with long descenders and the underline overlapping:

![Text is now more crisp as canvas is no longer stretched, causing anti-aliasing to look poorly](images/1_71/terminal-descenders.png)

Underline styles and colors are currently not supported on Windows due to [an outstanding issue in ConPTY](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/7228).

### Rendering improvements

Several improvements were made to terminal rendering:

* A [longstanding bug](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/85154) that sometimes caused blurriness when the workbench was zoomed in or out has been fixed!

  ![Text is now more crisp as canvas is no longer stretched, causing anti-aliasing to look poorly](images/1_71/terminal-blurry.png)

* When minimum contrast ratio is enabled and the text luminance needs to be flipped to ensure the ratio is met, the text's hue will now retained.

  ![Bold yellow text on red in some themes will now display as dark yellow instead dark grey](images/1_71/terminal-mcr-flip.png)

* The new theme key `terminal.inactiveSelectionBackground` is available to show a different selection background color whether the terminal is focused or not to better align with the editor.

  ![Most themes now dim the selection background color when not focused](images/1_71/terminal-inactive.png)

* Custom powerline glyph rendering has improved edge clipping, this is most noticable on the semi-circle characters which should now be a smooth curve.

  ![Powerline glyphs are no longer cut off on the edges](images/1_71/terminal-powerline-clip.png)

## Debugging

### `suppressMultipleSessionWarning` option in launch.json

When a user tries to start debugging with a launch config, but there is already an active debug session for that config, then we show a warning dialog before starting the second instance, because this is easy to do on accident and is usually not what the user meant to do. But if running multiple instances of the same config is part of your workflow, you can now disable this warning by adding `"suppressMultipleSessionWarning": true` to the launch config.

## Contributions to extensions

### Live Preview
Live Preview has now officially released support for multi-root workspaces! Although users could have technically used Live Preview in multi-root workspaces before, we have now implemented a cleaner way to support it.

Now, the extension spawns a new server for each root in your multi-root workspace; therefore, links that are relative to the root of your project (i.e., ones that start with a `/`) will work properly when previewing multi-root workspaces.

![Live Preview Multi-root Demo](images/1_71/live-preview-multi-root-demo.gif)
_Theme: [GitHub Dark Dimmed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

You can view the servers that were opened by the extension by hovering Live Preview's status bar indicator (usually located on the bottom-right corner). In this case, a server started for each workspace (on port 3000 and 3002), and there was another server spawned for the file that was not from any open workspace (on port 3004).

## Extension Authoring

### TerminalExitStatus.reason

TODO: @meganrogge https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/130231

### Missing documentation for `enumItemLabels` added

Enum settings in the Settings editor support the `enumItemLabels` key, which allows the extension author to specify the values to be shown in the dropdowns corresponding to the `enum` values.

![Example of enumItemLabels with a mock setting. The selectbox displays the label value, and the dropdown options display both the label value and the enum value, though the enum values are rendered less prominently.](images/1_71/enum-item-labels.png)
