# August 2022 (version 1.71)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the August 1.71 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the August milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22August+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Merge editor improvements

#### Restoring old conflict decorators

To improve the transition between text and merge editors we no longer disable the old inline conflict decorators. When the new merge editor opens, you can get the previous experience with a single click in the editor toolbar:

![Use 'Open File' in the merge editor to see old decorators](images/1_71/merge-editor-open-file-old-decorators.gif)

By clicking the same icon next to the file name in the SCM view, you can skip the new merge editor directly.

However, you can switch between the new and old experience at any time and even use them in parallel:

![The new and old merge experiences can be used at the same time](images/1_71/merge-editor-side-by-side.gif)

#### Keeping git conflict markers

We no longer modify the result file when opening it in the new merge editor (conflicting regions were replaced with base). Instead, we now hide the conflict markers in the result view.
The checkboxes can be used to replace the conflict markers with either side, a combination of both sides or, by unchecking them, with base.

#### Checkbox improvements

We now make sure that the checkboxes of a conflict are always visible, even when the conflict is larger than the viewport.
We also use colors to emphasize the checkboxes for unhandled conflicts.

#### Opening the merge editor from files with conflicts

A file that has a conflict will now automatically show an **Open in Merge Editor** button to transition between the text and merge editors.

![Conflicting files shows hint to open merge editor](images/1_71/mergeHint.gif)

#### Diffing algorithm improvements

We started exploring alternative diffing algorithms to improve the quality of conflicts.
This new experimental diffing algorithm can be enabled with the following setting:
```json
"mergeEditor.diffAlgorithm": "experimental",
```
This new algorithm is not optimized for performance yet, but already improves the merge editor experience for many edge-cases.

#### Outlook

In this release, we focused on the most important UX issues of the merge editor and fixed [many bugs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Amerge-editor+milestone%3A%22August+2022%22+is%3Aclosed). If you still find yourself confused by the new merge editor, we would love to hear from you! Please create a [new issue in our repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/new), share a screenshot and your merge editor state (`Copy Merge Editor State as JSON`). We really appreciate all the feedback we got so far, and all the future feedback will help us make the merge editor experience great for everyone.

Our future work will focus on a [separate base view](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/155277), [conflict minification](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/157496), diffing algorithm refinement and [other improvements](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Amerge-editor+milestone%3A%22September+2022%22).

### FFmpeg codecs support

The [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) shared library that ships as part of the VS Code previously had only support for the `FLAC` codec. With this release, the library has been updated to support the following list of codecs and containers. This will allow more audio and video files to be played from Notebooks or by extensions embedding audio and video in webviews.

* Vorbis
* Flac
* H.264
* VP8
* WAV
* MP3
* Ogg

### Explorer rename selection improvements

After initiating a rename action on a file, pressing the `F2` key will cycle through the file name, entire selection, and file extension to allow for more flexible keyboard only interaction.

![A file in the Explorer being renamed demonstrating that subsequent presses of the F2 key toggle selecting various pieces of the file name](images/1_71/renameToggle.gif)

### Rounded buttons

We've update all of our buttons to have a slight rounded corner to better match our design aesthetic.

![An example of a button with rounded corners](images/1_71/rounded-buttons.png)

## Editor

### Sticky Scroll

Sticky scroll is a feature that shows the current scope at the top of the view port. It is no longer experimental and can be enabled through the settings with `editor.stickyScroll.enable`. The changes made are:

* It is possible to choose the maximum number of lines to display.
* It is possible to `Ctrl/Cmd + Click` in the sticky scroll, to navigate to a definition.

![Sticky Scroll Control/Command Click](images/1_71/sticky-scroll-ctrlclick.gif)

### Configure suggest matching

There is a new setting to configure IntelliSense filtering. By default, the first character must match a word start, for example `c` must match `console` or `WebContext` but won't match `description`. The `editor.suggest.matchOnWordStartOnly` setting changes this behavior. When disabled, filtering takes any match into account - this leads to more results but filtering still happens by match quality.

![IntelliSense demo with and without match on word start](images/1_71/suggestMatchWordStart.gif)

### New Code Action control

We've completely overhauled the Code Action control. Instead of a simple menu of Code Actions, there is now a custom control that makes it easier to find the Code Action you want:

![The new code action widget](images/1_71/code-action-widget.png)

Switching to the new control also lets VS Code surface additional information. For example, you can now hover over disabled Code Actions to learn why they are disabled:

![Hovering over disabled code action to understand why it is disabled](images/1_71/code-action-disabled-hover.png)

You can also customize the keybindings used to navigate through the Code Action list with `selectNextCodeAction`, `selectPrevCodeAction`, and `acceptSelectedCodeAction`.

Going forward, the new code action UI provides a great foundation for further UX improvements. Be sure to let us know if you have any suggestions!

## Source Control

### Commit action button improvements

Users can globally control the secondary action (ex: `pull`, `sync`) that is being executed following a successful commit operation using the `git.postCommitCommand` setting. This milestone we have added a new setting, `git.rememberPostCommitCommand`, that can be used to remember the last executed secondary action per repository.

## Terminal

### Shell integration improvements

The following improvements to shell integration were made this release:

* Fish shell integration is available as an experimental manual install only. See the [Shell Integration documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_manual-installation) for how to install it.
* Git bash for Windows shell integration is available as an experimental manual install only. See the [section on manual installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_manual-installation) for details.
* Support for common alternative current working directory sequences: `OSC 6 ; scheme://<cwd> ST`, `OSC 1337 ; CurrentDir=<cwd> ST`, `OSC 9 ; 9 ; <cwd> ST`
* [Better handling of various edge cases](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+assignee%3ATyriar+milestone%3A%22August+2022%22+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aterminal-shell-integration+label%3Abug).

### Smooth scrolling

The terminal now supports smooth scrolling, which will animate scrolling for a short period of time to help orient yourself after scrolling, similar to the editor and lists. To enable it set:

```json
"terminal.integrated.smoothScrolling": true
```

### Underline styles and colors

Underline styles and colors are now supported using the escape sequences [originally pioneered by the kitty terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/underlines/). For supporting programs, these new underlines should light up automatically, provided they send these sequences to the VS Code terminal.

![The terminal can now display straight, double, curly, dotted and dashed underlines in any color](images/1_71/terminal-underlines.png)

Included in this change is improved underline rendering when GPU acceleration is enabled, which avoids glyphs with long descenders and the underline overlapping:

![Text is now more crisp as canvas is no longer stretched, causing anti-aliasing to look poorly](images/1_71/terminal-descenders.png)

Underline styles and colors are currently not supported on Windows due to [an outstanding issue in ConPTY](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/7228).

### Rendering improvements

Several improvements were made to terminal rendering:

* A [longstanding bug](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/85154) that sometimes caused blurriness when the workbench was zoomed in or out has been fixed!

  ![Text is now more crisp as canvas is no longer stretched, causing anti-aliasing to look poorly](images/1_71/terminal-blurry.png)

* When minimum contrast ratio is enabled and the text luminance needs to be flipped to ensure the ratio is met, the text's hue will now be retained.

  ![Bold yellow text on red in some themes will now display as dark yellow instead dark grey](images/1_71/terminal-mcr-flip.png)

* The new theme key `terminal.inactiveSelectionBackground` is available to show a different selection background color whether the terminal is focused or not to better align with the editor.

  ![Most themes now dim the selection background color when not focused](images/1_71/terminal-inactive.png)

* Custom Powerline glyph rendering has improved edge clipping. This is most noticeable on the semi-circle characters, which should now be a smooth curve.

  ![Powerline glyphs are no longer cut off on the edges](images/1_71/terminal-powerline-clip.png)

## Tasks

### Reconnection on window reload

Watch tasks now get reconnected to on window reload, enabling uninterrupted work when VS Code is updated or an extension's state changes. Task reconnection is enabled by default, but can be disabled with the `task.reconnection` setting.

[The VS Code build task is reconnected to on window reload](images/1_71/task-reconnection.gif)

## Debugging

### suppressMultipleSessionWarning option in launch.json

When you try to start debugging with a launch configuration, but there is already an active debug session for that configuration, VS Code will show a warning dialog before starting the second instance. This is easy to do by accident and is usually not what you meant to do. However, if running multiple instances of the same configuration is part of your workflow, you can now disable this warning by adding `"suppressMultipleSessionWarning": true` to your `launch.json` configuration file.

## Extension provided tree views

### `workbench.tree.expandMode`

The setting `workbench.tree.expandMode` will now be respected by tree views that are contributed by extensions.

### Disabled tree items

Tree items with commands which have their enablement clause resolving to false will be displayed as disabled.

## Comments

### Filtering

The Comments view has a new filter where you can filter by comment text and by resolved/unresolved state.

![Comments filtering](images/1_71/comments-filtering.gif)

### Editor decoration

The comments editor gutter decoration now uses codicons and has new styling.

![Comments editor gutter decoration](images/1_71/comments-editor-decoration.gif)

## Simple file dialog

### Create new folder

You will now be prompted to create folder segments that don't exist when using the simple file dialog.

## Languages

### TypeScript 4.8

VS Code now ships with TypeScript 4.8.2. This major update brings language improvements for type checking and inference. On the tooling side, you also should see some nice performance improvements and bug fixes!

Check out the [TypeScript 4.8 announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-8/) for more about this update.

And if you missed the recent VS Code [livestreams](https:/code.visualstudio.com/livestreams) on TypeScript, have a look at two recent sessions with [Matt Pocock](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk).

## Contributions to extensions

### Jupyter

#### Improved IntelliSense for Jupyter Notebooks with Pylance

IntelliSense support for Jupyter Notebooks with Python kernels is now much better when using [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance), thanks to the [updates in the Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#whatIsNew) to include notebook support.

Not only you will get improved auto completion options when writing Python code in notebook files, but you will also be able to use refactoring features such as Extract Variable, Extract Method, and Rename Symbol, as well as auto imports and semantic highlighting.

![Writing Python code showing auto import, auto complete suggestions, extract method and a rename symbol functionality.](images/1_71/pylance-notebooks-lsp.gif)

_Theme: [Horizon Extended](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LanceWilhelm.horizon-extended)_

### Live Preview

Live Preview has now officially released support for [multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces)! Although users could have technically used Live Preview in multi-root workspaces before, we have now implemented a cleaner way to support it.

The Live Preview extension now spawns a new server for each root in your multi-root workspace; therefore, links that are relative to the root of your project (ones that start with a `/`) will work properly when previewing multi-root workspaces.

![Live Preview Multi-root Demo](images/1_71/live-preview-multi-root-demo.gif)

_Theme: [GitHub Dark Dimmed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

You can view the servers that were opened by the extension by hovering Live Preview's Status bar indicator (located on the bottom-right corner). In the image below, a server started for each workspace (on ports 3000 and 3002), and there was another server spawned for the file that was not from any open workspace (on port 3004).

![Live Preview Multi-root Demo Ports](images/1_71/live-preview-server-status.png)

Download the [Live Preview extension](http://aka.ms/live-preview) and try it out today! 📡✨🔎

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. Highlights of this release include:

* Notifications for pull requests.
* Review comments can be resolved/unresolved directly from the pull request overview.

Check out the [changelog for the 0.50.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0500) release of the extension to see the other highlights.

## Preview features

### Settings Profiles

We have been working the last couple of months to support **Settings Profiles** in VS Code, which is one of the most popular asks from the community. This feature is available for preview via `workbench.experimental.settingsProfiles.enabled` setting. Try it out and let us know your feedback by creating issues in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) or commenting in [issue #116740](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/116740). Please note that we enabled this feature in this stable release behind the mentioned experimental flag.

In this milestone, we added CLI support for **Settings Profiles** feature. You can now pass the name of the profile using `--profile` arg and open a folder or a workspace using that profile. Following instruction opens the **web-sample** folder with the **Web Development** profile. If the profile does not exist, a new empty profile with the given name is created.

`code ~/projects/web-sample --profile "Web Development"`

We also added support for **Temporary Settings Profile** that can be created and associated to a folder or workspace temporarirly. This profile gets auto deleted once it is not associated to any folder or worksapce.

![Temporary Settings Profile Demo](images/1_71/settings-profiles-temp.gif)

You can also create a temporary settings profile and associate it to a folder or a workspace from CLI using `--profile-temp` flag. Following instruction opens the **try-out-sample** folder with a temporary profile that gets deleted after closing the folder.

`code ~/projects/try-out-sample --profile-temp`

### Bring your uncommitted changes with you when you Continue Working On a repository

When you are browsing a GitHub or Azure Repos repository such as https://vscode.dev/github/microsoft/vscode, you can use the ["Continue Working On"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_continue-working-on) command to select a different development environment to work on your repository.

Previously, if you had pending edits in your virtual workspace, you would need to push them to GitHub or Azure Repos to view them elsewhere. This milestone, we have added Edit Sessions integration to the "Continue Working On" feature, so that your uncommitted changes automatically travel with you to your target development environment, such as a GitHub codespace:

<video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls>
  <source src="/release-notes/images/1_71/continue-working-on-codespace.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

To try this out, set `"workbench.experimental.editSessions.enabled": true` in your settings, enable Settings Sync, and run the `Edit Sessions: Sign In` command in VS Code for the Web and desktop.

When you are using VS Code for the Web, your uncommitted changes will then travel with you when you use Continue Working On in:
* A new cloud hosted environment in GitHub Codespaces
* A new local clone of your GitHub repository
* A local VS Code instance with the same virtual GitHub repository

When you are using desktop VS Code with the Remote Repositories extension, your uncommitted changes will travel with you when you use Continue Working On in:
* A cloud hosted environment in GitHub Codespaces (available via the GitHub Codespaces extension)
* A new local clone of your GitHub repository
* A new clone of your GitHub repository in a container volume (available via the Remote-Containers extension)
* https://vscode.dev
* An existing local folder containing a clone of your repository

## Extension Authoring

### TerminalExitStatus.reason

Extension authors now have better insight into why a terminal exited via the new `TerminalExitReason` API.

```json
export enum TerminalExitReason {
  Unknown = 0,
  Shutdown = 1,
  Process = 2,
  User = 3,
  Extension = 4,
}
```

### Enum settings enumItemLabels documentation

Enum settings in the Settings editor support the `enumItemLabels` key, which allows the extension author to specify the values to be shown in the dropdowns corresponding to the `enum` values.

![Example of enumItemLabels with a mock setting. The select box displays the label value, and the dropdown options display both the label value and the enum value, though the enum values are rendered less prominently.](images/1_71/enum-item-labels.png)

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme)_

### New activeWebviewPanelId context key

The new `activeWebviewPanelId` [context key](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/when-clause-contexts) tracks the `viewType` of the currently focused webview panel. You can use it in when clauses to enable commands or menu items when your webview is focused

```json
"when": "activeWebviewPanelId == 'markdown.preview'
```

### TypeScript server plugins on web

[TypeScript language service plugins](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Writing-a-Language-Service-Plugin) are now supported on web! This applies to plugins that are contributed by extensions using the `typescriptServerPlugins` contribution point.

To get started, you must first tell TypeScript that your plugin is web enabled by adding a `browser` entrypoint in your `package.json` in addition to `main`:

```json
"main": "out/main.js",
"browser": "out/main.browser.js"
```

The `browser` entrypoint must be a JS module that exports a default function that activates the plugin:

```ts
export default function init(modules: { typescript: typeof import("typescript/lib/tsserverlibrary") }) {
  ...
};
```

Keep in mind that on web your plugin will be running in a normal web worker environment, so you can use Node.js APIs such as `fs`.

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Proposal for a 'startDebugging' request

Today VS Code supports multiple concurrent debug sessions but the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) covers only a single session. That means that creating new debug sessions programmatically is not part of DAP and can only be done outside of DAP or the debug adapter, typically in the debug extension that contains the debug adapter.
A consequence of this is that multi-session functionality like debugging child-processes is not easily available for non-VS Code DAP clients that only reuse the debug adapter and not the VS Code specific debug extension.

To improve this situation we are planning to add a new reverse request to DAP that allows to create a new debug session from inside the debug adapter. After some rounds of discussions we've prepared a [proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/issues/79#issuecomment-1230242253) for a `startDebugging` reverse request. If you are a "debug extension" or "DAP client" author and interested in this DAP protocol addition, we'd appreciate your feedback.
