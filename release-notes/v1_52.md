# November 2020 (version 1.52)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.52 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[November iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/110690)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Better handling of preview editors

[Preview editors](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_preview-mode) are now better handled with numerous improvements based on feedback and making this feature work more consistent.

The setting `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromQuickOpen` is now disabled by default so that editors opening from quick open will not appear in preview mode anymore.

When you start a navigation (e.g. go to definition), the editor you start from will move out of preview mode to keep it open while the new editor will be in preview mode until you navigate further.

![Go to definition](images/1_52/goto-definition.gif)

We changed all of our custom trees (the ones used from extensions or Git changes view for example) to work more consistently like our built-in trees (like the explorer). This means, the following interactions now apply to all of them:
* double-click or mouse-middle-click to open non-preview
* `Enter` to open non-preview (`Space` to open in preview-mode)

**Note:** if you are the author of an extension that is leveraging our custom tree API, you can benefit from this change as well. Make sure to use `vscode.open` or `vscode.diff` commands for the `TreeItem.command` and you are in!

A new menu item in the editor overflow menu allows to quickly turn off preview editors altogether:

### New setting to restore previous session windows

A new setting value `preserve` for the existing `window.restoreWindows` setting allows to enforce that every window you had opened before closing VSCode is restored when you start VSCode, even if VSCode is explicitly asked to open a specific folder or file. A common example is double-clicking on a file to open it in VSCode or using the terminal to open a specific file or folder. Without `window.restoreWindows: preserve` in that case, VSCode will only open the file or folder as instructed, but not restore any other window.

### New setting to disable editor group splitting on drag & drop

A new setting `workbench.editor.splitOnDragAndDrop` allows to disable editor group splitting when using drag & drop of editors. There is also a way to toggle this conditionally during the drag and drop operation when you press and hold `Shift` key (macOS) or `Alt` key (Windows, Linux).

### SCM changes show their parent folder contained in

Compare editors opened from the SCM changes view will now reveal the path they are in (when tabs are disabled). Previously only the name would show, but now the parent folder appears if the before and after is contained in the same folder.

### New proxy login dialog enabled by default

Our new proxy login dialog is now enabled by default. You can read our [previous release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_51#_remember-proxy-credentials) for more details. The setting `window.enableExperimentalProxyLoginDialog` can be used to enable the old one, but we will remove this support in the near future. If you find an issue with the new login dialog, please tell us.

### Improved terminal environment handling (Linux, macOS)

When you start VSCode on Linux or macOS for the first time from e.g. the dock or a launcher (and not the terminal), we start a little background process to resolve your shell environment (e.g. as defined or changed by `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`). We then use all environment variables for VSCode so that starting from a terminal or the dock/launcher does not make any difference e.g. for debug or tasks executed.

Unfortunately we do not open VSCode until this little background process has executed. To not block startup for too long, we still proceed opening VSCode after 10s though. In this case we now inform you that we were unable to resolve the shell environment and offer a link to [learn more](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Resolving-Shell-Environment-is-Slow):

![Shell Env Error](images/1_52/shell-env-error.png)

Similarly we show a warning after 3s to indicate that VSCode startup was blocked resolving your shell environment:

![Shell Env Warning](images/1_52/shell-env-warning.png)

We are actively looking into changing our strategy to not block VSCode from starting while still resolving the shell environment in the background, but this will probably only be possible in future milestones.

Other changes in this area that are noteworthy:
* you can now define and change environment variables from a terminal before launching a second window of VSCode and these are properly overwriting the variables from the first launch effectively allowing for per-window environment variables
* environment variables that are set from a terminal before launching a second window of VSCode are now preserved even when you switch folders in that second window

## Web

### Home indicator is now a menu

The home indicator is now a menu containing navigation related entries.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Statusbar Entry background color API

We propose a new property `backgroundColor` for  `StatusBarItem` to set the background color of a status bar entry. Currently only `statusBarItem.errorBackground` is supported to avoid that the status bar looks too colorful. We may expand this support to more colors in the future.

![Status Error](images/1_52/status-error.png)

The use case for this new API is to enable extensions to indicate error conditions in the status bar. For exmple, the ESLint extension may decide to use this color when ESLint has not been enabled for the workspace yet to draw attention from the user.

## Engineering

### Sandbox and context isolation enabled for issue reporter and process explorer

To get more feedback from enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation), we pushed to enable it for our process explorer and issue reporter windows. This configuration will eventually be the default also for the main VSCode window:
* `sandbox` enabled
* `contextIsolation` enabled
* resources are served from a custom `vscode-file` scheme (and not `file`)

## New commands

| Key                                               | Command                                       | Command ID                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `kb(workbench.action.compareEditor.focusPrimarySide)`  | Focus Primary Side in Diff Editor | `workbench.action.compareEditor.focusPrimarySide`  |
| `kb(workbench.action.compareEditor.focusSecondarySide)` | Focus Secondary Side in Diff Editor | `workbench.action.compareEditor.focusSecondarySide` |
| `kb(workbench.action.compareEditor.focusOtherSide)` | Focus Other Side in Diff Editor | `workbench.action.compareEditor.focusOtherSide` |

## Notable fixes
