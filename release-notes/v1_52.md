# November 2020 (version 1.52)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the November 2020 release of Visual Studio Code. As announced in the [November iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/110690), we continued to focus for two weeks on housekeeping GitHub issues and pull requests as documented in our [issue grooming guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Grooming). Across all of our VS Code repositories, we closed (either triaged or fixed) **5242** issues, which is even more than during our last housekeeping iteration in [October 2019](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_40), where we closed **4622** issues. While we closed issues, you created **2937** new issues. The main [vscode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) now has 2146 open feature requests and 884 open bugs. In addition, we closed **144** pull requests.

Same as every year, we used the [live tracker](https://vscode-issue-tracker.netlify.com/) from [Benjamin Lannon](https://github.com/lannonbr) to track our progress:

![Burn down chart of VS Code issues](images/1_52/november-issue-grooming.png)

After focusing on housekeeping, we have also addressed several feature requests and community [pull requests](#thank-you). Read on to learn about new features and settings.

## Workbench

### Better handling of preview editors

We've made several improvements to [preview editors](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_preview-mode) based on feedback.

The `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromQuickOpen` setting is now disabled by default, so that editors opened from **Quick Open** will no longer appear in preview mode.

When you start a navigation (for example, with **Go to Definition**), the editor you start from will move out of preview mode and stay open, while the new editor will be in preview mode until you navigate further.

![Go to Definition](images/1_52/goto-definition.gif)

We changed all of our custom trees (the ones used in the **Extensions** or **Git Views**, for example) to work more consistently like our built-in trees (like the **File Explorer**). This means, the following interactions now apply to all of them:

* Double-click or mouse-middle-click to open in non-preview.
* `kbstyle(Enter)` to open non-preview (`kbstyle(Space)` to open in preview-mode).
* `kbstyle(Alt+Click)` to open an editor to the side of the active one.

**Note:** If you are the author of an extension that is using our custom tree API, you can benefit from this change as well. Make sure to use `vscode.open` or `vscode.diff` commands for the `TreeItem.command` to get the new preview mode behavior.

A new menu item, **Keep Editors Open**, in the editor overflow menu allows you to quickly turn off preview editors altogether:

![Keep Open](images/1_52/keep-open.png)

### Restore previous session windows

A new value `preserve` for the existing `window.restoreWindows` setting lets you enforce that every window you had opened before closing VS Code is restored when you start VS Code, even if VS Code is explicitly asked to open a specific folder or file. A common example is double-clicking on a file to open it in VS Code or using the terminal to open a specific file or folder. Without the `window.restoreWindows: preserve` setting, VS Code will only open the file or folder as instructed, but not restore any other window.

### Disable editor group splitting on drag & drop

A new setting `workbench.editor.splitOnDragAndDrop` prevents editor group splitting when using dragging and dropping editors. There is also a way to toggle this conditionally during the drag and drop operation by pressing and holding the `kbstyle(Shift)` key (macOS) or `kbstyle(Alt)` key (Windows, Linux).

### Undo file operations in Explorer

Explorer now supports **Undo** and **Redo** for all file operations: delete, rename, copy, move, new file and new folder. Make sure the focus is in the Explorer and trigger the **Undo** or **Redo** commands and your last file operation will be undone or redone respectively. Keep in mind that we have separate undo stacks for the Editor and the Explorer, and we choose which one to undo based on focus.

![Explorer Undo](images/1_52/explorer-undo.gif)

### Progress for long running operations in Explorer

We now show progress in the Explorer and Status Bar for long running File operations (longer than 500 ms). There is also an initial support for canceling these long running operations. This should be helpful when copying large folders or downloading resources from remote.

![Explorer Progress](images/1_52/explorer-progress.gif)

### Open Editors sorting

We have introduced a new setting `explorer.openEditors.sortOrder`. It can either have the default value `editorOrder` - editors are ordered in the same order editor tabs are shown or a newly introduced `alphabetical` - editors are ordered in alphabetical order inside each editor group. The `alphabetical` sorting only has an effect on the **Open Editors** view, it will not "move tabs" in any way.

This should help when you have lots of files open and you want to match up files that are associated (for example, hello.component.js and hello.component.html).

![Open Editors sorted](images/1_52/open-editors-sorted.png)

### Accessible progress

Workbench progress has been made more accessible. We set the appropriate aria roles so the screen reader reads progress for all long running operations in VS Code. Most screen readers by default only announce progress if it is ongoing for more than 10 seconds.

### SCM changes show their parent folder path

Compare editors opened from the **SCM View** will now reveal the path they are in (when tabs are disabled). Previously only the name would show, but now the parent folder appears if the before and after are within the same folder.

![SCM Changes](images/1_52/git-editor-label.png)

### New proxy login dialog enabled by default

Our new proxy login dialog is now enabled by default. You can read our [previous release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_51#_remember-proxy-credentials) for more details. The setting `window.enableExperimentalProxyLoginDialog` can be used to enable the old one, but we will remove this support in the near future. If you find an issue with the new login dialog, please let us know by filing an [issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

### Improved terminal environment handling (Linux, macOS)

When you start VS Code on Linux or macOS for the first time via the dock or a launcher (and not the terminal), VS Code starts a background process to resolve your shell environment (as defined or changed by `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`). All environment variables detected are then used by VS Code so that starting from a terminal or the dock/launcher does not make any difference, which is important when debugging or executing tasks.

Unfortunately, VS Code does not open until this background process has executed. In order to not block startup for too long, VS Code will begin opening after 10 seconds. In this case, VS Code now informs you that it was unable to resolve the shell environment and offers a link to [learn more](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Resolving-Shell-Environment-is-Slow):

![Shell Env Error](images/1_52/shell-env-error.png)

Similarly, VS Code now shows a warning after 3 seconds to indicate that VS Code startup was blocked resolving your shell environment:

![Shell Env Warning](images/1_52/shell-env-warning.png)

We are actively looking into changing our strategy to not block VS Code from starting while still resolving the shell environment in the background, but this will only be possible in future milestones.

Other noteworthy changes in this area are:

* You can now define and change environment variables from a terminal before launching a second window of VS Code, and these will properly overwrite the variables from the first launch, effectively allowing for per-window environment variables (for example, this enables you to change the Node.js version via a tool such as `nvm` per window before starting).
* Environment variables that are set from a terminal before launching a second window of VS Code are now preserved even when you switch folders in that second window.

## Debugging

### Breakpoints View: Conditions for exception breakpoints

We now support editing conditions for Exception breakpoints from the **Breakpoints View** using the **Edit Condition** context menu action.

For now, only the Mock Debug extension has (fake) Exception Breakpoint condition support, but soon other debug extensions will follow - such as the JavaScript debugger.

![Edit Condition](images/1_52/edit-condition.png)

![Exception Condition](images/1_52/exception-condition.png)

### Exception area accessibility

The exception information area in the editor has been made more accessible. While debugging once an exception is hit, VS Code will automatically move focus to the Exception area, which will make screen readers read the exception details and the stack frame.

It is now also possible to close the exception widget area using the `kbstyle(Escape)` key or the X action in the top right of the Exception area.

### UI Improvements

**Debugged line shown in overview ruler**

We now show the currently debugged line in the overview ruler on the right of the editor. For this decoration, we use the already present `editor.stackFrameHighlightBackground` color. In addition to this, we also show the currently focused debugged line in the overview ruler using the `editor.focusedStackFrameHighlightBackground` color (focused debugged lines are non-top stack frame locations, which are manually selected in the **Call Stack View**).

**Automatic debug configurations improvements**

 Previously, we introduced a feature so that extension authors can analyze the current project and offer debug configurations automatically. These debug configurations are dynamically created and so they do not show up in the `launch.json` configuration file. In this milestone, we are also preserving recently used automatic debug configurations across VS Code reloads to make the whole experience smoother for the user. In a case that an automatic debug configuration is no longer valid after a reload, VS Code will ask the user to pick a new automatic configuration from the same provider once debugging is started.

**Debug Hover: help text/tip in the bottom to switch to normal hover**

We added a small help text on the bottom of the debug hover to make the `kbstyle(Alt)` switch to editor language hover while debugging more discoverable. As a refreshment: while debugging, the debug hover takes precedence over the language hover, making it impossible to see the language hover. You can switch from the debug hover back to the language hover by holding down the `kbstyle(Alt)` modifier key. As long as `kbstyle(Alt)` is pressed, the language hover is shown instead of the debug hover. This makes it much easier to read Javadoc while debugging.

![Debug hover alt](images/1_52/debug-hover-alt.png)

**Debug Console: collapse identical lines**

The Debug Console now collapses identical output by showing the count of how many times it occurred. This feature should make it much easier to make sense of repetitive program output.

![Debug Console collapse](images/1_52/repl-collapse.png)

### New variables for launch.json and tasks.json

The following new variables have been introduced:

* `${fileWorkspaceFolder}` resolves to the workspace folder path of the file open in the active VS Code editor.
* `${fileDirnameBasename}` TODO @alexr00
* `${pathSeparator}` resolves to the character used by the operating system to separate components in file paths.

### serverReadyAction: launch other debug config by name

The [`serverReadyAction`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_automatically-open-a-uri-when-debugging-a-server-program) has historically been able to launch a browser or Chrome debugging by matching a URL. This release adds a new option to launch another arbitrary configuration by name, for example, in your launch.json you can specify:

```js
"serverReadyAction": {
  "action": "startDebugging",
  "pattern": "listening on port ([0-9]+)",
  "name": "Launch Browser"
}
```

This allows you to pass additional options in standard Chrome debug configurations and use other debuggers with the serverReadyAction.

### Debug Auto Attach: new option to disable temporarily

Auto attach can now be disabled temporarily via the **Auto Attach** item in the status bar, or via the **Debug: Toggle Auto Attach** command. Disabling auto attach in this way applies only to the current window and does not require restarting your terminal. It can be re-enabled in the same way.

![Image showing the auto attach quick pick with an option that reads "Temporarily disable auto attach in this session"](images/1_52/auto-attach-disable.png)

### JavaScript Debugger

> A complete list of changes can be found in the debugger's [changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#changelog).

**Breakpoint Diagnostic Tool**

There is a new tool that is designed to help troubleshoot build or configuration issues that prevent debugging or prevent breakpoints from binding. To use it, run the **Debug: Create Diagnostic Information for Current Session** command while a debug session is running. In a later VS Code version, a hint for this diagnostic tool will appear automatically when appropriate.

**Setting for Default Executable Locations**

There is a user setting, `debug.javascript.defaultRuntimeExecutable`, which allows you to specify the default locations of Node or Chrome binaries. For example, `{ "pwa-chrome": "dev" }` will use the "dev" build of Chrome whenever you debug with Chrome-type configurations.

Note that to use this new option, you want to make sure that your launch configuration is `pwa-node` instead of `node`, or `pwa-chrome` instead of Chrome.

## Extensions

In this milestone, we added a number of improvements to the **Extension View** and **Extension Editor**.

* Extensions views are now refreshed automatically, for example, an extension is shown in the **Installed Extensions** view immediately after installing the extension. You can also refresh the view manually using the refresh action in the title.

![Extensions Auto Refresh](images/1_52/extensions-auto-refresh.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)*

* The **Extension Editor** now shows all of the actions for an extension, like the **Extension View**.

![Extension Editor Actions](images/1_52/extension-editor-actions.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)*

* The **Feature Contributions** tab in the **Extension Editor** now shows Activation Events for an extension.

![Extension Activation Events](images/1_52/extension-activation-events.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)*

* You can now disable an extension and its dependents together. The following notification with a **Disable All** action is shown when you disable an extension with dependents.

![Disable Extension](images/1_52/extension-disable.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)*

* You can add or remove an extension from workspace recommendations using the **Add to Workspace Recommendations** or **Remove from Workspace Recommendations** actions available in an extension's context menu in the **Extension View**.

![Extension Add Recommendation](images/1_52/extension-add-recommendation.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)*

* Extension recommendation notifications now show the install dropdown action when Settings Sync is enabled, just like in the **Extension View**.

![Extension Recommendation Notifications](images/1_52/extension-recommendation-notification.png)

* We simplified configuring extension recommendations by deprecating `extensions.showRecommendationsOnlyOnDemand` setting. You can now use the `extensions.ignoreRecommendations` setting to control extension recommendation notifications, and the **Extension View**'s visibility actions to hide the recommendations by default.

### Trouble shooting: Extension bisect

The true power of VS Code is its extensions: theme extensions add pretty colors and icons, language extensions provide IntelliSense and enable code navigation, debugger extensions enable you to drill into bugs. Sometimes it isn't obvious if an issue is caused by an extension, and if so, by which extension. Until today, you needed to disable all extensions and then one by one re-enable extensions to find a bad extension. This process is now getting easy with a new feature called extension bisect. It uses the binary search algorithm to quickly identify an extension that causes trouble. In essence, it disables half your extensions and asks you to check for the issue you were seeing. If the issue is gone the bad extension must have been in the list of disabled extensions, otherwise in the list of enabled extensions. This process is now repeated on the list, which must contain the bad extension until only a single extension is left.

You can start extension bisect via **Start Extension Bisect**. It then guide through the process of repeatedly disabling and re-enabling extensions. After each reload you will be prompted to confirm if the issue is still there.

![Start Extension Bisect](images/1_52/ext_bisect1.png)

![Extension Bisect Prompting](images/1_52/ext_bisect2.png)
Extension Bisect will repeatedly ask you to check if the issue is still there or not. You can always abort via **Stop Bisect** and when having dismissed the bisect notification you can continue via **Continue Extension Bisect**.

![Extension Bisect Done](images/1_52/ext_bisect3.png)
When the extension bisect process is finished, you are asked to file an issue against the extension. You can also keep the extension disabled from here.

## Keyboard Shortcuts editor

We've added several improvements to the **Keyboard Shortcuts Editor** in this milestone.

You can now configure a keybinding for a command from the Command Palette.

![Configure Keybinding](images/1_52/configure-keybinding.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)*

You can add several keybindings to a command from the Keyboard Shortcuts editor.

![Add Keybinding](images/1_52/add-keybinding.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)*

You can filter by a particular column from search input:

* `@command:${commandId}` - filters by command ID.
* `@keybinding:"${keybinding}"` - filters by keybinding.
* `@source:user|default|extension` - filters by source.

You can navigate search history in the Keyboard Shortcuts editor using `kbstyle(Up)` and `kbstyle(Down)` arrows.

## IntelliSense

### Word-based suggestions from other documents

VS Code supports simple word-based suggestions. They are useful when a language service isn't available or when a language service cannot compute results, like when typing inside comments. With this release, VS Code can be configured to suggest words from other open files as well. Use the `editor.wordBasedSuggestionsMode` setting with `allDocuments` to suggest words from all open files, use `matchingDocuments` to suggest words from open files of the same language, and use `currentDocument` (default) to only suggest words from the current file.

![word based suggestions](images/1_52/suggest-words.png)

### Hide inline details

Suggestions in VS Code have details that show in a separate view beside the suggestion. That details view can be turned off, and a preview of the details will show inline with suggestions. This sometimes takes away too much space and can now be configured via: `editor.suggest.showInlineDetails`.

### TypeScript suggestions show path

TypeScript can provide completions that also add an import-statement. However, when there are multiple symbols with an equal name it is hard to pick the right completion. This release makes this simpler because paths of auto-import completions are shown with the label.

![TypeScript show import path](images/1_52/suggest-details.png)

### Customize CodeLens

You can now configure the font family and size of code lenses.

![Custom Code Lens Font](images/1_52/codelens-custom.png)

In the screen capture above, font and size are customized using these two settings:

```json
"editor.codeLensFontFamily": "Comic Sans MS",
"editor.codeLensFontSize": 12,
```

## Snippets

### Hide extension snippet

Snippets contributed by extensions can now be hidden from IntelliSense. This feature is available from the "Insert Snippet" picker when you run **Insert Snippet**. Find an extension snippet that you want to hide, and select the eye-icon on the right.

![Hide Extension Snippet](images/1_52/snippet-hide.png)

Hidden snippets aren't showing in IntelliSense but can still be used via **Insert Snippet**. Last, when using settings sync, then hidden snippets will be synchronized across your devices.

### Snippets without prefix

When authoring snippets, you can now omit the prefix-property. Snippets with a prefix don't show in IntelliSense but can be used via **Insert Snippet**.

## Integrated Terminal

### Terminal configuration support

You can now modify terminal settings by selecting **Configure Terminal Settings** in the terminal dropdown menu.

![Configure Terminal Settings](images/1_52/configure-terminal-settings.gif)

### Keybindings management

By default, keybindings are dispatched to the workbench instead of the terminal as specified in `terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell`. This notification informs the user when they have entered a keybinding corresponding to one of these commands and provides the option to configure the relevant settings.

To send most keybindings to the terminal instead of the workbench, set `terminal.integrated.sendKeybindingsToShell`.

![Send Keybindings to Shell](images/1_52/terminal-keybindings-notification.gif)

## Languages

### Markdown inline smart select

Expand and shrink selection in Markdown documents using the following commands:

* Expand: `kb(editor.action.smartSelect.expand)`
* Shrink: `kb(editor.action.smartSelect.shrink)`

Selection applies to italics, bold, inline code blocks, and links.

![Smart select within a Markdown document expands from the content within an inline markdown type to include the markdown symbols.](images/1_52/inline-markdown-smart-select.gif)

## TypeScript 4.1

This release of VS Code includes (TypeScript 4.1.2)[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/]. This major TypeScript update brings support for a number of new language features — including [template literal types](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/#template-literal-types) and support for [React 17's factories](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/#jsx-factories) — as improving language tooling for JavaScript and TypeScript. As always, it also includes a number of bug fixes.

You can read more about TypeScript 4.1 on the (TypeScript Blog)[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/].

### Initial support for JSDoc @see tags

<!-- TODO: add example -->

### js/ts.implicitProjectConfig.strictNullChecks and js/ts.implicitProjectConfig.strictFunctionTypes

These two new settings control IntelliSense and type checking behave in JavaScript and TypeScript file that are not part of an explicit tsconfig or jsconfig project

— The `js/ts.implicitProjectConfig.strictNullChecks` setting enables [strict null checks](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html). It is `false` by default.

    If you are working in TypeScript, you definitely want to enable strict null checks as it can catch many common programming mistakes.

    Strict null checks are also helpful while working in JavaScript. When strict null checks are enabled, hover and IntelliSense information will show which types can `undefined` and `null`. If you [enable type checking in your JavaScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/javascript#_type-checking), VS Code can also use strict null checks to catch some common programming mistakes.

- The `js/ts.implicitProjectConfig.strictFunctionTypes` enables [strict function types](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/18654). It is `true` by default.

    Strict function types are more difficult to explain but also generally improve IntelliSense and can catch some programming mistakes.

Keep in mind that these settings are both overridden if a file is part of a jsconfig or tsconfig project.

### Renaming the other implicit JS/TS project settings

The other implicit project settings for JavaScript and TypeScript have been renamed to make them more accurate:

- `javascript.implicitProjectConfig.checkJs` -> `js/ts.implicitProjectConfig.checkJs`
- `javascript.implicitProjectConfig.experimentalDecorators` -> `js/ts.implicitProjectConfig.experimentalDecorators`

These settings were renamed because they apply to both JavaScript and TypeScript files that are not part of a jsconfig or tsconfig project. The previous setting names suggested they only applied to JavaScript files.

## Browser support

### Home indicator is now a menu

The home indicator is now a menu containing navigation-related entries.

![Web Home Indicator](images/1_52/home-indicator.png)

## Contributions to extensions

### Remote Development

Work continues on the [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), which allow you to use a container, remote machine, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Feature highlights in 1.52 include:

* New command to install remote extensions locally.
* You can now select a branch when you open a repository in a container.
* Server startup performance improvements by installing extensions in the background.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/tree/master/remote-release-notes/v1_52.md).

### Notebooks

The VS Code team is continuing work on native support for Notebooks and improving its UX and performance. You can find the notable fixes [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Anotebook+milestone%3A%22November+2020%22+is%3Aclosed).

**Improve large text output rendering**

The native notebook editor will now truncate the output if its content is too large to ensure the UI is always responsive. You can still allow you to open the full raw content of the output in a text editor.

![Large Output Rendering Optimization](images/1_52/notebook-large-output-optimization.gif)

## Extension authoring

### File Decoration API

The `FileDecorationProvider` API is now final and can be used by any extension. With this API ambient information can be added to files, for the SCM and error decorations that show in the explorer use this API.

### Undoing resource changes

Explorer operations like create file, rename file or delete file raise events, which allow participation, for example, `onWillCreateFiles`, `onWillRenameFiles`, or `onWillDeleteFiles`. This release adds support for undoing such explorer operations and you should know that the aforementioned events are not fired when undoing an operation.

### New theme colors

* `statusBarItem.errorBackground`: Status bar error items background color. Error items stand out from other status bar entries to indicate error conditions.
* `statusBarItem.errorForeground`: Status bar error items foreground color. Error items stand out from other status bar entries to indicate error conditions.

### Error background colors

Theme authors can now leverage new theme colors for errors in the editor. Editor errors, warnings, and infos can now be styled via:

* `editorError.background`
* `editorWarning.background`
* `editorInfo.background`

![Error background colors](images/1_52/editor-error-background.png)

### Updated Codicons

We've added the following new icons to our [codicon library](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels):

* `check-all`
* `circle-large-filled`
* `circle-large-outline`
* `pass-filled`
* `pinned-dirty`

![Codicons updates](images/1_52/codicons-updated.png)

### Support codicons for view containers & views

You can now use codicons as icons for view containers and views. Example:

```json
"views": {
      "explorer": [
        {
          "id": "npm",
          "name": "NPM Scripts",
          "icon": "$(code)",
          "visibility": "hidden"
        }
      ]
  }
```

### Open Keyboard Shortcuts editor with query filter

Extensions can now pass query text while opening the Keyboard Shortcuts editor using the command `workbench.action.openGlobalKeybindings`.

```ts
vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.openGlobalKeybindings', 'query')
```

### fs.isWritableFileSystem

The new `fs.isWritableFileSystem` api lets you check if a given file system supports writing. For example, to check if a document with a url of `example:/path/to/file` is on a writeable file system:

```ts

switch (vscode.fs.isWritableFileSystem('example')) {
  case true:
    // The `example` filesystem supports writing.
    // Keep in mind the permissions or other issues may still prevent
    // a file from being written.
    break;

  case false:
    // The `example` filesystem does not support writing (it is readonly).
    break;

  case undefined:
    // VS Code does not know about the `example` filesystem
    break;
}
```

[Custom editors](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors) can use `fs.isWritableFileSystem` to determine if they show a readonly UI.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Status bar entry background color API

We propose a new property `backgroundColor` for  `StatusBarItem` to set the background color of a Status bar entry. Currently only `statusBarItem.errorBackground` is supported to avoid the Status bar looking too colorful. We may expand this support to more colors in the future.

![Status Error](images/1_52/status-error.png)

The use case for this new API is to enable extensions to indicate error conditions in the Status bar. For example, the ESLint extension may decide to use this color to alert the user that ESLint has not yet been enabled for a workspace.

### Removal of proposed logging API

A proposal for a logging API existed around a year ago, and has now been removed. Extensions can use the output channel API for logging, or, when using a custom logger, use `ExtensionContext#logUri`.

### Initial addition of proposed testing API

We are investigating [testing in VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/107467), and the first version of the API is now present in `vscode.proposed.d.ts`. Please read the linked issue for additional context, and participate if you have input to give. We expect to ship the provider portion of the API significantly earlier than the observer portion.

## Language Server Protocol

The feature set for the 3.16 version of the Language Server Protocol has been finalized and is available [here](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-16/). The major highlights of the 3.16 version are:

- [Semantic tokens](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-16/#textDocument_semanticTokens)
- [Call hierarchy](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-16/#textDocument_prepareCallHierarchy)
- [Linked editing](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-16/#textDocument_linkedEditingRange)

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Support for Conditional Exception

In this milestone, the "conditional exceptions" [proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/issues/137) from September 2020 has been finalized and is now part of the version 1.43 of the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) (DAP).

The protocol addition extends the `setExceptionBreakpoints` request with a new optional `filterOptions` property for setting the exception filters and their conditions. A debug adapter can announce that it supports the "conditional exceptions" feature via the `supportsExceptionFilterOptions` capability.

### Clarified semantics of StackTraceResponse.totalFrames

The description of the `supportsDelayedStackTraceLoading` capability in the Debug Adapter Protocol seems to suggest that in order for delayed stack frame loading to work, the adapter must populate the `totalFrames` field of the `StackTraceResponse` with the **correct** number of available stack frames. However, for some debuggers or runtimes, this value is not easy to compute which makes it expensive to support delayed stack frame loading.

Since the total number of frames is never surfaced in the UI, we have clarified the original - somewhat lacking - semantics description of `totalFrames`: a debug adapter is now free to provide a large (incorrect) value for `totalFrames` and a client should be prepared to receive fewer frames than requested, and use this as an indication that the end of the stack has been reached.

### Clarified semantics of RunInTerminalRequestArguments.cwd

Since the `cwd` property ("current working directory") of the `runInTerminal` request is **not** optional, it is not possible omit the property in order to express the "don't care" case. For example if a debug adapter knows that the "cwd" is already correct and that there is no need to have the client generate a "change directory" command, the DAP specification does not describe how to achieve this.

To address this shortcoming, we have clarified the DAP specification by adding that a client is only expected to execute a change directory command if the `cwd` property contains a non-empty path.

## Engineering

### Sandbox and context isolation enabled for issue reporter and process explorer

To get more feedback from enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation), we pushed to enable it for our Process Explorer and Issue Reporter windows. This configuration will eventually be the default also for the main VS Code window:

* `sandbox` enabled
* `contextIsolation` enabled
* resources are served from a custom `vscode-file` scheme (and not `file`)

## New commands
