# November 2020 (version 1.52)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.52 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[November iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/110690)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Better handling of preview editors

We've made several improvements to [preview editors](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_preview-mode) based on feedback.

The `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromQuickOpen` setting is now disabled by default, so that editors opening from Quick Open will no longer appear in preview mode.

When you start a navigation (for example, with **Go to Definition**), the editor you start from will move out of preview mode and stay open, while the new editor will be in preview mode until you navigate further.

We changed all of our custom trees (the ones used in the **Extensions** or **Git Views**, for example) to work more consistently like our built-in trees (like the **File Explorer**). This means, the following interactions now apply to all of them:

* Double-click or mouse-middle-click to open in non-preview.
* `kbstyle(Enter)` to open non-preview (`kbstyle(Space)` to open in preview-mode).

**Note:** If you are the author of an extension that is using our custom tree API, you can benefit from this change as well. Make sure to use `vscode.open` or `vscode.diff` commands for the `TreeItem.command` to get the new preview mode behavior.

A new menu item, **Keep Editors Open**, in the editor overflow menu allows you to quickly turn off preview editors altogether:

![Keep Open](images/1_52/keep-open.png)

### Restore previous session windows

A new value `preserve` for the existing `window.restoreWindows` setting lets you enforce that every window you had opened before closing VS Code is restored when you start VS Code, even if VS Code is explicitly asked to open a specific folder or file. A common example is double-clicking on a file to open it in VS Code or using the terminal to open a specific file or folder. Without the `window.restoreWindows: preserve` setting, VS Code will only open the file or folder as instructed, but not restore any other window.

### Disable editor group splitting on drag & drop

A new setting `workbench.editor.splitOnDragAndDrop` prevents editor group splitting when using dragging and dropping editors. There is also a way to toggle this conditionally during the drag and drop operation by pressing and holding the `kbstyle(Shift)` key (macOS) or `kbstyle(Alt)` key (Windows, Linux).

### SCM changes show their parent folder path

Compare editors opened from the SCM changes view will now reveal the path they are in (when tabs are disabled). Previously only the name would show, but now the parent folder appears if the before and after are within the same folder.

### New proxy login dialog enabled by default

Our new proxy login dialog is now enabled by default. You can read our [previous release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_51#_remember-proxy-credentials) for more details. The setting `window.enableExperimentalProxyLoginDialog` can be used to enable the old one, but we will remove this support in the near future. If you find an issue with the new login dialog, please let us know by filing an [issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

### Improved terminal environment handling (Linux, macOS)

When you start VS Code on Linux or macOS for the first time via the dock or a launcher (and not the terminal), VS Code starts a background process to resolve your shell environment (as defined or changed by `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`). All environment variables detected are then used by VS Code so that starting from a terminal or the dock/launcher does not make any difference, which is important when debugging or executing tasks.

Unfortunately, VS Code does not open until this background process has executed. In order to not block startup for too long, VS Code will begin opening after 10 seconds. In this case, VS Code now informs you that it was unable to resolve the shell environment and offers a link to [learn more](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Resolving-Shell-Environment-is-Slow):

![Shell Env Error](images/1_52/shell-env-error.png)

Similarly, VS Code now shows a warning after 3 seconds to indicate that VS Code startup was blocked resolving your shell environment:

![Shell Env Warning](images/1_52/shell-env-warning.png)

We are actively looking into changing our strategy to not block VS Code from starting while still resolving the shell environment in the background, but this will only be possible in future milestones.

Other noteworthy changes in this area are:

* You can now define and change environment variables from a terminal before launching a second window of VS Code, and these will properly overwrite the variables from the first launch, effectively allowing for per-window environment variables (for example, this enables you to change the Node.js version via a tool such as `nvm` per window before starting).
* Environment variables that are set from a terminal before launching a second window of VS Code are now preserved even when you switch folders in that second window.

## Integrated Terminal

### Terminal configuration support

You can now modify terminal settings by selecting **Configure Terminal Settings** in the terminal dropdown.

### Keybindings Management

By default, keybindings are dispatched to the workbench instead of the terminal as specified in `terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell`. This notification informs the user when they have entered a keybinding corresponding to one of these commands and provides the option to configure the relevant settings.

To send most keybindings to the terminal instead of the workbench, set `terminal.integrated.sendKeybindingsToShell`.

## Browser support

### Home indicator is now a menu

The home indicator is now a menu containing navigation related entries.

## Extension authoring

### New theme colors

* `statusBarItem.errorBackground`: Status bar error items background color. Error items stand out from other status bar entries to indicate error conditions.
* `statusBarItem.errorForeground`: Status bar error items foreground color. Error items stand out from other status bar entries to indicate error conditions.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Status bar entry background color API

We propose a new property `backgroundColor` for  `StatusBarItem` to set the background color of a Status bar entry. Currently only `statusBarItem.errorBackground` is supported to avoid the Status bar looking too colorful. We may expand this support to more colors in the future.

![Status Error](images/1_52/status-error.png)

The use case for this new API is to enable extensions to indicate error conditions in the Status bar. For example, the ESLint extension may decide to use this color to alert the user that ESLint has not yet been enabled for a workspace.

## Engineering

### Sandbox and context isolation enabled for issue reporter and process explorer

To get more feedback from enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation), we pushed to enable it for our Process Explorer and Issue Reporter windows. This configuration will eventually be the default also for the main VS Code window:

* `sandbox` enabled
* `contextIsolation` enabled
* resources are served from a custom `vscode-file` scheme (and not `file`)
