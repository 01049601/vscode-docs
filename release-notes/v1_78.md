Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.78 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.
