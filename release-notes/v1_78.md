# April 2023 (version 1.78)

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.78 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/178951)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22April+2023%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

### Glyph margin decoration rendering improvements

This month, we've improved the rendering of decorations which appear in the editor margin. Debugging-related decorations such as breakpoints and stackframe pointers will always render next to the editor line numbers. Additional decorations will render to the left of any debugging-related decorations. This allows you to view your breakpoints even if there are other decorations on the same line, such as test decorations or bookmarks.

### Standalone Color Picker

It is now possible to spawn a standalone color picker in order to insert and replace colors. To spawn/focus it, select `Show or Focus Standalone Color Picker` from the command palette. When no colors or color formats are provided by extensions, the color-picker falls back on CSS formatted colors. It is also now possible to visualize inline color decorators for CSS-formatted colors in all file types. To see these decorators, enable `Editor: Default Color Decorators`.

## Terminal

## Source Control

### Quick fixes in the SCM input

## Notebooks

### Drop image files into notebooks to create attachments

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Languages

### Drag and drop videos into Markdown files

### Strict nulls for JavaScript script blocks in HTML

You can now use the `js/ts.implicitProjectConfig.strictNullChecks` setting to enable script nulls for JavaScript in HTML script blocks:

![Strict nulls in a script block](images/1_78/html-strict-null.png)

With strict nulls enabled, hovers and other IntelliSense features will show when a type can be nullable. For example, notice how `el` now has a type of `HTMLElement | null`. This is because `document.getElementById` returns null if it can find an element with that id.

## VS Code for the Web

### Commit Git Large File Storage files from github.dev and vscode.dev

You can now commit files tracked with Git LFS to GitHub when using github.dev and vscode.dev.


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_77.md).

## Preview Features

### TypeScript 5.1 Support

This update includes support for the upcoming TypeScript 5.1 release. See the [TypeScript 5.1 Beta blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-1-beta/) and  [TypeScript 5.0 iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/53031) for more details on what the TypeScript team is currently working on. Some editor tooling highlights:

* Linked editing support for JSX tags.
* Snippet Completions for `@param` JSDoc Tags.

To start using the TypeScript 5.1 nightly builds, install the [TypeScript Nightly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) extension.

### Rename matching JSX tags using `F2`

When you trigger rename on a JSX tag, we now rename just the matching tag instead of trying to update all references to the tag:

<video src="images/1_78/ts-rename-jsx.mp4" controls loop muted autoplay title="Renaming a JSX tag using F2"></video>

This requires TypeScript 5.1+ and matches how rename works in HTML.

You can disable this behavior using `javascript.preferences.renameMatchingJsxTags` and `typescript.preferences.renameMatchingJsxTags`.

## Extension authoring

### Workspace edits can now create files directly from `DataTransferFile`

On of the primary uses of the [drop into editor API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/drop-on-document) is writing dropped files/content into the workspace. However in previous VS Code releases, this could be fairly slow for large files. This is because the file contents end up being copied between processes twice: first from the renderer to the extension host to read the file contents, and then back from the extension host to the renderer to write the file.

```ts
class CreateFileDropProvider implements vscode.DocumentDropEditProvider {
	async provideDocumentDropEdits(_document: vscode.TextDocument, _position: vscode.Position, dataTransfer: vscode.DataTransfer, _token: vscode.CancellationToken): Promise<vscode.DocumentDropEdit | undefined> {
		const pngFile = dataTransfer.get('image/png')?.asFile();
		if (!pngFile) {
			return;
		}

		// Read file
		// This results in the entire file contents being copied over to the extension host.
		const contents = await pngFile.data();

		// Now create a workspace edit that writes the file into the workspace
		// This results in the same file contents from above being copied back again.
		const additionalEdit = new vscode.WorkspaceEdit();
		const path = vscode.Uri.joinPath(vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders![0].uri, 'image.png');
		additionalEdit.createFile(path, { contents });

		const edit = new vscode.DocumentDropEdit(path.fsPath);
		edit.additionalEdit = additionalEdit;
		return edit;
	}
}
```

Now you can avoid those extra copies though by passing a `DataTransferFile` directly to `WorkspaceEdit.createFile`:

```ts
additionalEdit.createFile(path, { contents: pngFile });
```

This should significantly improve performance, especially when working with larger files.

### Resolve Code action commands in resolveCodeAction

A `CodeActionProvider` can now lazily resolve the command of `CodeAction` in `resolveCodeAction`. Previously only the edits for the code action could be lazily resolved.

If the command is expensive to compute, this allows a `CodeActionProvider` to defer this work until the code action is going to be applied.

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Format multiple ranges

The `DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider`-API has an optional proposed function that allows it to support formatting multiple ranges at once. Provider adopting this API will help improve the format modified ranges flow because only a single request to a language service is needed.

### Document drop metadata

This new proposal enriches the existing [Drop into editor](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/drop-on-document) API to support the [new drop widget](#drop-selector). Providers can use it to provide a better drop into editor experience.

The first part of this proposal adds a `label` property to `DocumentDropEdit`. This human readable label describes the edit and is shown in the drop widget UI:

![Labels shown in the drop widget](images/1_78/notebook-drop.png)

The second part adds an extra `metadata` argument to `registerDocumentDropEditProvider`. This metadata argument identifies the provider and lets it tell VS Code which types of content it applies to:

```ts
vscode.languages.registerDocumentDropEditProvider('markdown', new InsertBase64ImageProvider(), {
    // Unique id that identities this provider
    id: 'insertBase64Image',

    // Array of mime types, such as `image/png` or `text/plain`, that this provider supports.
    // You can also use wildcards, such as `image/*` which matches any image content that is dropped.
    dropMimeTypes: ["image/*"]
})
```

`dropMimeTypes` can help improve performance as it means your provider will only be called for relevant dropped content.
