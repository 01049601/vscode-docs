# April 2023 (version 1.78)

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.78 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/178951)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22April+2023%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

### Glyph margin decoration rendering improvements

This month, we've improved the rendering of decorations which appear in the editor margin. Debugging-related decorations such as breakpoints and stackframe pointers will always render next to the editor line numbers. Additional decorations will render to the left of any debugging-related decorations. This allows you to view your breakpoints even if there are other decorations on the same line, such as test decorations or bookmarks.

### New Default Themes

## Editor

### Drop selector

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Standalone Color Picker

It is now possible to spawn a standalone color picker in order to insert and replace colors. To spawn/focus it, select `Show or Focus Standalone Color Picker` from the command palette. When no colors or color formats are provided by extensions, the color-picker falls back on CSS formatted colors. It is also now possible to visualize inline color decorators for CSS-formatted colors in all file types. To see these decorators, enable `Editor: Default Color Decorators`.

## Terminal

## Source Control

### Quick fixes in the SCM input

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Notebooks

### Drop image files into notebooks to create attachments

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Languages

### Rename matching JSX tags using `F2`

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Drag and drop videos into Markdown files

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Strict null checking for JavaScript script blocks in HTML

You can now use the `js/ts.implicitProjectConfig.strictNullChecks` setting to enable script null checking for JavaScript in HTML script blocks:

## VS Code for the Web

### Commit Git Large File Storage files from github.dev and vscode.dev

You can now commit files tracked with Git LFS to GitHub when using github.dev and vscode.dev.


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_77.md).

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.
