## Accessibility

### Aria verbosity settings

Screen reader users can exclude hints from a feature's `aria-label` to decrease redundancy via `"accessibility.verbosity.diff-editor"` and `"accessibility.verbosity.terminal"`.

### Terminal

#### Terminal accessible buffer improvements

* Jump between commands using `kb(workbench.action.terminal.accessibleBufferGoToNextCommand)` and `kb(workbench.action.terminal.accessibleBufferGoToPreviousCommand)`.
* Use **Set Selection Anchor**, **Select from Anchor to Cursor**, and page navigation via `kb(cursorPageUpSelect)` and `kb(cursorPageDownSelect)`
* Preview the position when using **Terminal: Navigate Accessible Buffer** (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.navigateAccessibleBuffer)` before accepting a command to go to a new location.
* Engage with the output while dynamic updates occur.

#### Terminal accessibility help menu

The terminal's **Accessibility Help** menu can now be navigated using arrow keys.

<video src="images/1_78/terminal-accessibility-help.mov" placeholder="images/1_78/terminal-accessibility-help.mov" autoplay loop controls muted title="the terminal accessibility help menu is entered and a user navigates it line by line with arrow keys">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
</video>

### Diff editor audio cue improvements

VS Code now caches audio cues so they only have to be loaded once, yielding better responsiveness, and have improved the tones used for the diff editor.

### Go to Line/Column announcement

When **Go to Line/Column...** (`kb(workbench.action.gotoLine)`) is invoked, the screen reader now reads the associated line content.

## Workbench

### New Default Themes

<!-- TODO daviddossett -->

![Light Modern theme](images/1_78/light-modern.png)

### Glyph margin decoration rendering improvements

This month, we've improved the rendering of decorations that appear in the editor margin. Debugging-related decorations such as breakpoints and stack frame pointers will always render next to the editor line numbers. Additional decorations render to the left of any debugging-related decorations. This allows you to view your breakpoints even if there are other decorations on the same line, such as test decorations or bookmarks.

![See bookmarks next to breakpoint and stack frame pointer decorations](./images/1_78/glyph-decorations.png)

### Copy images from the image preview

You can now copy images from the built-in image preview using `kb(editor.action.clipboardCopyAction)` or by right-clicking in the preview and selecting **copy**. The copied image data can be pasted back into VS Code or into other applications.

## Editor

### Drop selector

VS Code lets you drop files and content into text editors by holding `kbstyle(Shift)` before dropping. In this update, we've added UI that lets you change how this content is inserted into the file. After dropping an image into a Markdown file for example, this control lets you switch between inserting a Markdown image, a workspace relative path to the image, and the full path to the image:

<video src="images/1_78/drop-widget.mp4" controls muted looped title="Changing how an image is dropped using the drop selector widget"></video>

The drop selector control appears whenever you drop content and there is more than one possible way it could be inserted. You can open the control by clicking on it or using `kb(editor.changeDropType)`. The drop selector goes away as soon as you start typing or move the cursor outside of the inserted text. You can also fully disable the drop selector control using `"editor.dropIntoEditor.showDropSelector": "never"`.

VS Code includes a few built-in ways to drop common content formats. Extensions can also add their own drop options using the `DocumentDropEditProvider` API.

### Standalone color picker

It is now possible to spawn a standalone color picker in order to insert and replace colors. To spawn/focus it, select **Show or Focus Standalone Color Picker** from the Command Palette. When no colors or color formats are provided by extensions, the color-picker falls back on CSS formatted colors. It is also now possible to visualize inline color decorators for CSS-formatted colors in all file types. To see these decorators, enable the **Editor: Default Color Decorators** (`editor.defaultColorDecorators`) setting.

### New snippet variable for timezone offset

A new snippet variable, `CURRENT_TIMEZONE_OFFSET`, is now available. This variable returns the current timezone offset in the format `+HHMM` or `-HHMM` (e.g. `-0700`). This complements other time-related snippet variables such as `CURRENT_YEAR`, `CURRENT_MONTH`, `CURRENT_DAY_NAME` etc

## Terminal

## Source Control

### Quick Fixes in the Source Control input

Code Actions and Quick Fixes are now supported in the Source Control message box:

<video src="images/1_78/scm-quick-fix.mp4" title="Fixing a spelling error in the quick input" controls muted looping autoplay></video>

The [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) extension, for example, adds spelling fixes to the Source Control input. Extensions can contribute additional fixes and Code Actions.

## Notebooks

### Drop image files into notebooks to create attachments

You can now drag and drop image files into notebook Markdown cells to create attachments. When you drop the image, use [the new drop selector control](#drop-selector) to select **Insert Image as Attachment**:

![Using the drop selector in a notebook Markdown cell](images/1_78/notebook-drop.png)

This adds the image to the notebook as an attachment instead of simply adding a link to the image:

![An image file added as an attachment](images/1_78/notebook-drop-attachment.png)

## Languages

### Drag and drop videos into Markdown files

Want to insert a video into your Markdown? Just drag it into the editor and then hold shift to drop it into the file:

<video src="images/1_78/md-video-insert.mp4" controls autoplay muted looped title="Inserting a video using drag and drop"></video>

This inserts a `<video>` tag pointing to the image. You can drag videos from VS Code's Explorer or from your local operating system.

### Strict nulls for JavaScript script blocks in HTML

You can now use the `js/ts.implicitProjectConfig.strictNullChecks` setting to enable strict nulls for JavaScript in HTML script blocks:

![Strict nulls in a script block](images/1_78/html-strict-null.png)

With strict nulls enabled, hovers and other IntelliSense features show when a type can be nullable. For example, notice how `el` now has a type of `HTMLElement | null`. This is because `document.getElementById` returns null if it can't find an element with that ID.

## VS Code for the Web

### Commit files to Git Large File Storage

Git LFS allows you to efficiently store large files in Git repositories. [github.dev](https://github.dev) and [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) now support committing files to Git Large File Storage in repositories hosted on GitHub, enabling easy updates from your browser without needing to install the LFS extension for Git locally.

LFS commit support in github.dev and vscode.dev works out of the box when your repository already has a `.gitattributes` file in the root of your repository that specifies which file types should be stored with Git LFS. To set up your repository for Git LFS for the first time, see the [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.com) documentation.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_77.md).

## Contributions to extensions

## Preview Features

### TypeScript 5.1 Support

This update includes support for the upcoming TypeScript 5.1 release. See the [TypeScript 5.1 Beta blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-1-beta) and  [TypeScript 5.0 iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/53031) for more details on what the TypeScript team is currently working on. Some editor tooling highlights:

* Linked editing support for JSX tags.
* Snippet Completions for `@param` JSDoc Tags.

To start using the TypeScript 5.1 nightly builds, install the [TypeScript Nightly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) extension.

### Rename matching JSX tags using `F2`

When you trigger rename on a JSX tag, we now rename just the matching tag instead of trying to update all references to the tag:

<video src="images/1_78/ts-rename-jsx.mp4" controls loop muted autoplay title="Renaming a JSX tag using F2"></video>

This requires TypeScript 5.1+ and matches how rename works in HTML.

You can disable this behavior using `javascript.preferences.renameMatchingJsxTags` and `typescript.preferences.renameMatchingJsxTags`.

## Extension authoring

### Workspace edits can now create files directly from `DataTransferFile`

One of the primary uses of the [drop into editor API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/drop-on-document) is writing dropped files/content into the workspace. However in previous VS Code releases, this could be fairly slow for large files. This is because the file contents end up being copied between processes twice: first from the renderer to the extension host to read the file contents, and then back from the extension host to the renderer to write the file.

```ts
class CreateFileDropProvider implements vscode.DocumentDropEditProvider {
    async provideDocumentDropEdits(_document: vscode.TextDocument, _position: vscode.Position, dataTransfer: vscode.DataTransfer, _token: vscode.CancellationToken): Promise<vscode.DocumentDropEdit | undefined> {
        const pngFile = dataTransfer.get('image/png')?.asFile();
        if (!pngFile) {
            return;
        }

        // Read file
        // This results in the entire file contents being copied over to the extension host.
        const contents = await pngFile.data();

        // Now create a workspace edit that writes the file into the workspace
        // This results in the same file contents from above being copied back again.
        const additionalEdit = new vscode.WorkspaceEdit();
        const path = vscode.Uri.joinPath(vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders![0].uri, 'image.png');
        additionalEdit.createFile(path, { contents });

        const edit = new vscode.DocumentDropEdit(path.fsPath);
        edit.additionalEdit = additionalEdit;
        return edit;
    }
}
```

Now you can avoid those extra copies though by passing a `DataTransferFile` directly to `WorkspaceEdit.createFile`:

```ts
additionalEdit.createFile(path, { contents: pngFile });
```

This should significantly improve performance, especially when working with larger files.

### Resolve Code Action commands in resolveCodeAction

A `CodeActionProvider` can now lazily resolve the command of `CodeAction` in `resolveCodeAction`. Previously only the edits for the Code Action could be lazily resolved.

If the command is expensive to compute, this allows a `CodeActionProvider` to defer this work until the Code Action is going to be applied.

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Format multiple ranges

The `DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider` API has an optional proposed function to support formatting multiple ranges at once. By adopting this API, providers improve the format modified ranges flow because only a single request to a language service is needed.

### Document drop metadata

This new proposal enriches the existing [Drop into editor](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/drop-on-document) API to support the [new drop selector](#drop-selector). Providers can use it to provide a better drop into editor experience.

The first part of this proposal adds a `label` property to `DocumentDropEdit`. This human readable label describes the edit and is shown in the drop selector UI:

![Labels shown in the drop selector](images/1_78/notebook-drop.png)

The second part adds an extra `metadata` argument to `registerDocumentDropEditProvider`. This metadata argument identifies the provider and tells VS Code the types of content it applies to:

```ts
vscode.languages.registerDocumentDropEditProvider('markdown', new InsertBase64ImageProvider(), {
    // Unique id that identities this provider
    id: 'insertBase64Image',

    // Array of mime types, such as `image/png` or `text/plain`, that this provider supports.
    // You can also use wildcards, such as `image/*` which matches any image content that is dropped.
    dropMimeTypes: ["image/*"]
})
```

The `dropMimeTypes` array can help improve performance as your provider is only called for relevant dropped content.

### editor/lineNumber/context menu

You can now contribute actions to a context menu anchored to the editor line number and glyph margin. Actions contributed to this menu receive the line number in command arguments and can reference the `editorLineNumber` context key in their when clauses.
