# August 2021 (version 1.60)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the August 1.60 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the August milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[August iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/130368)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22August+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Extension authoring

### Short title for commands

The [`commands`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.commands)-contribution point allows extensions to define UI-properties for commands, like title, category, or icon. Menus on the other hand are "places" that display commands and for that they select some or all UI-properties. For instance, some menus render only icons while others render titles or category plus title. Sometimes it is hard to come up with a command title that works equally well for global and local menus, e.g the command palette needs more words than a context menu. 

For that a new `shortTitle`-property exists. It allows commands to provide a shorter title that works well in context, like _"Notebook: Clear All Cell Output"_ in the command palette vs _"Clear All"_ in the notebook toolbar. 

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [vscode.proposed.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Support for type hierarchy

There is an API proposal for a [`TypeHierarchyProvider`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/75f509fa8ac66f0909f9958de17b9e0a8a10a937/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L2808-L2808) which allows extensions to provide super- and sub-types for symbols. The API is ready to be tried.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.
