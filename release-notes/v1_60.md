# August 2021 (version 1.60)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the August 1.60 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the August milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[August iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/130368)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22August+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Locked editor groups

With the introduction of [terminals in the editor area](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_58#_terminals-in-the-editor-area), we received more and more reports of users getting frustrated that a terminal editor would get replaced with a file editor too easily and by accident. By default, files will always open in the active editor group and thus when a terminal was active, a file would open and as such hide the terminal.

Locked editor groups provide a new way of handling this issue not only for terminals but for any editor. If you have more than one editor group opened, you can now lock it, either using one of the new commands or from the "..." overflow menu:

Locked groups behave different to other unlocked groups like so:
* new editors will not open in a locked group unless explicitly moved there by the user (e.g. via drag and drop)
* if an editor skips a locked group for opening it will either open in the most recently used unlocked group or create a new group to the side of the locked one
* the locked state of an editor group is persisted and restored across restarts
* you can lock empty groups as well allowing for some more stable editor layouts
* a locked group indicates as such with a lock icon in the action toolbar (top right)

See the following demo of how locked editor groups behave in action. Even though the markdown preview is active, new files that open will open in the left editor group:

![Locked Editor Group](images/1_60/locked-editor-group.gif)

New commands that were added for this feature are:
* `workbench.action.experimentalLockEditorGroup`
* `workbench.action.experimentalUnlockEditorGroup`
* `workbench.action.experimentalToggleEditorGroupLock`

A new context key `activeEditorGroupLocked` can be used to conditionally bind commands depending on the locked state of a group.

**Note:** the associated setting and commands are experimental until we have finalized the design of locked editor groups. We are curious for feedback on this new feature, so please do not hesitate to [report issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).

### New `workbench.editor.experimentalAutoLockGroups` to auto-lock an editor group

Building on top of the new locked editor groups concept, the new `workbench.editor.experimentalAutoLockGroups` setting allows to enlist editors that should lock a group automatically when they open. This only applies to when the editor is the first to open in an otherwise empty or new group.

Terminals are configured by default to cause a new group to lock automatically. Even though the terminal is active, the selected file from the terminal will open in the left editor group:

![Auto Locked Editor Group](images/1_60/auto-locked-editor-group.gif)

If you want markdown previews to lock a group automatically, you can add `mainThreadWebview-markdown.preview: true` to the setting.

**Note:** In the next milestones we will work on improving the settings UX to be able to pick editors without having to know their identifiers.

**Note:** the associated setting and commands are experimental until we have finalized the design of locked editor groups. We are curious for feedback on this new feature, so please do not hesitate to [report issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).

### Terminal editor confirmation dialog

The dialog presented when closing a terminal editor that is marked as dirty is now specific for the terminal editor and will no longer offer a way to "Save" the terminal.

### Keep editors open instead of closing when they fail to restore

So far, when an editor failed to restore after reload of the window or restart of the application, the editor would automatically close until an editor was found that succeeds to load.

This behaviour can lead to frustrating results where a carefully created editor layout and arrangement is going away due to editors closing.

With this release, an editor that was once successfully opened will not close, even when it fails to restore. The editor indicates the problem and offers a way to retry the operation:

## Extension authoring

### Short title for commands

The [`commands`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.commands)-contribution point allows extensions to define UI-properties for commands, like title, category, or icon. Menus on the other hand are "places" that display commands and for that they select some or all UI-properties. For instance, some menus render only icons while others render titles or category plus title. Sometimes it is hard to come up with a command title that works equally well for global and local menus, e.g the command palette needs more words than a context menu.

For that a new `shortTitle`-property exists. It allows commands to provide a shorter title that works well in context, like _"Notebook: Clear All Cell Output"_ in the command palette vs _"Clear All"_ in the notebook toolbar.

### App Host added to environment namespace
The `.env` namespace has seen the addition of `appHost`. `appHost` allows extension developers better granularity when determining the environment which VS Code is hosted in. Examples include desktop, codespaces, and github.dev

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [vscode.proposed.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Support for type hierarchy

There is an API proposal for a [`TypeHierarchyProvider`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/75f509fa8ac66f0909f9958de17b9e0a8a10a937/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L2808-L2808) which allows extensions to provide super- and sub-types for symbols. The API is ready to be tried.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Notable fixes
