We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Locked editor groups

With the introduction of [terminals in the editor area](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_58#_terminals-in-the-editor-area), we received more and more reports of users getting frustrated that a terminal editor would get replaced with a file editor too easily and by accident. By default, files will always open in the active editor group and thus when a terminal was active, a file would open and as such hide the terminal.

Locked editor groups provide a new way of handling this issue not only for terminals but for any editor. If you have more than one editor group opened, you can now lock it, either using one of the new commands or from the "..." overflow menu:

![Locked Editor Group](images/1_60/locked-editor-group.png)

Locked groups behave different to other unlocked groups like so:
* new editors will not open in a locked group unless explicitly moved there by the user (e.g. via drag and drop)
* if an editor skips a locked group for opening it will either open in the most recently used unlocked group or create a new group to the side of the locked one
* the locked state of an editor group is persisted and restored across restarts
* you can lock empty groups as well allowing for some more stable editor layouts
* a locked group indicates as such with a lock icon in the action toolbar (top right)

![Locked Editor Group Layout](images/1_60/locked-editor-layout.png)

See the following demo of how locked editor groups behave in action. Even though the markdown preview is active, new files that open will open in the left editor group:

![Locked Editor Group](images/1_60/locked-editor-group.gif)

New commands that were added for this feature are:
* `workbench.action.experimentalLockEditorGroup`
* `workbench.action.experimentalUnlockEditorGroup`
* `workbench.action.experimentalToggleEditorGroupLock`

A new context key `activeEditorGroupLocked` can be used to conditionally bind commands depending on the locked state of a group.

**Note:** the associated setting and commands are experimental until we have finalized the design of locked editor groups. We are curious for feedback on this new feature, so please do not hesitate to [report issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).

### New `workbench.editor.experimentalAutoLockGroups` to auto-lock an editor group

Building on top of the new locked editor groups concept, the new `workbench.editor.experimentalAutoLockGroups` setting allows to enlist editors that should lock a group automatically when they open. This only applies to when the editor is the first to open in an otherwise empty or new group.

Terminals are configured by default to cause a new group to lock automatically. Even though the terminal is active, the selected file from the terminal will open in the left editor group:

![Auto Locked Editor Group](images/1_60/auto-locked-editor-group.gif)

If you want markdown previews to lock a group automatically, you can add `mainThreadWebview-markdown.preview: true` to the setting.

**Note:** In the next milestones we will work on improving the settings UX to be able to pick editors without having to know their identifiers.

**Note:** the associated setting and commands are experimental until we have finalized the design of locked editor groups. We are curious for feedback on this new feature, so please do not hesitate to [report issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).

### Automatic language detection

Last release, we introduced an experimental feature for untitled files that would automatically set the language mode for the file based on the contents. This feature uses machine learning to guess the language and is done entirely on your machine. It's powered by the open-source ML library, [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/), and the ML model from [Guesslang](https://github.com/yoeo/guesslang) by GitHub user [@yoeo](https://github.com/yoeo).

This release we are enabling this feature by default and also expanding the automatic language detection to files that don't have a file extension. In Notebooks, we provide an easy way to ask for language detection using the language picker. This enables a few fun scenarios:

* Grab an example from online and paste it in an untitled editor
![Language detection of untitled files](images/1_60/language-detection-untitled.gif)
*Theme: [Panda Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda)*

* "Pipe into code" language detection (showing off detection of extension-less files)
![Language detection of extension-less files](images/1_60/language-detection-pipe.gif)
*Theme: [Panda Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda)*

* Auto detect option in Notebooks language picker
![Language detection of Notebooks](images/1_60/language-detection-notebooks.gif)
*Theme: [Panda Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda)*

### Terminal editor confirmation dialog

The dialog presented when closing a terminal editor that is marked as dirty is now specific for the terminal editor and will no longer offer a way to "Save" the terminal.

![Dirty Terminal Editor Confirmation Dialog](images/1_60/dirty-terminal-dialog.png)

### Keep editors open instead of closing when they fail to restore

So far, when an editor failed to restore after reload of the window or restart of the application, the editor would automatically close until an editor was found that succeeds to load.

This behaviour can lead to frustrating results where a carefully created editor layout and arrangement is going away due to editors closing.

With this release, an editor that was once successfully opened will not close, even when it fails to restore. The editor indicates the problem and offers a way to retry the operation:

![Keep Editors Open](images/1_60/keep-editor-open.png)

### Syntax highlighting of codeblocks in the settings editor

[Fence code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting) in setting descriptions are now syntax highlighted:

![Syntax highlighting of TypeScript code in the settings editor](images/1_60/settings-editor-highlighting.png)


## Terminal

### Custom rendering of box drawing and block element characters

Box drawing and block element characters now use pixel-perfect custom glyphs instead of using the font when GPU acceleration is on (`terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration`). This means for example that boxes are drawn without gaps, even if you set line height or letter spacing in the terminal.

![](images/1_60/terminal-glyph-before.png)
![](images/1_60/terminal-glyph-after.png)

Here is an example of the terminal app zenith which shows the box drawing characters around sections as well as block elements for the charts:

![](images/1_60/terminal-custom-glyphs.png)

This can be disabled with `"terminal.integrated.customGlyphs": false`.

### Improved rendering of underscore for certain fonts

There's been some historical issues with how underscore is rendered to the terminal, most of which have been fixed by the now default WebGL renderer. There was one exception to this when the underscore character in the font unexpected is drawn below the bounds of the cell which happens under Linux for some reason.

Notice how the underscore on the lower row is rendered below the cell:

![The underscore was previously rendered 1 pixel below the cell's bounds](images/1_60/underscore-before.png)

While this works fine for most cases, it fails on the bottom row because it is drawn outside the bounds of the canvas.

We now work around this problem by detecting such a font and shifting the underscore texture up until it is within the bounds of the cell. This solution also applies to the canvas renderer which previously wouldn't show underscores for any rows because of how it clips the rows to avoid overlapping.

![The underscore is now at the bottom of the cell's bounds](images/1_60/underscore-after.png)

### Faster reconnection after reloading the window

Previously when reloading it could take up to 300ms parse the state of a terminal's buffer and there was a possibility of corruption. For several busy terminals this can quickly add up! The method of restoring the buffer has changed from recording a large number of recent raw terminal events on the [pty host](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_54#_new-terminal-process-layout) to maintaining a headless terminal frontend on the pty host and writing all data to that. This comes with several benefits:

- The amount of scrollback to restore can be fine tuned, the default is now 100 which is a good balance between speed and the amount of data. The scrollback amount can be changed with the `terminal.integrated.persistentSessionScrollback` setting.
- Thanks to [xterm.js'](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js) fast parser this should have minimal impact on CPU and reduce overall memory usage on the pty host.
- Terminal modes are now restored explicitly which could potentially get missed before, causing buffer corruption.
- There is no longer the need to replay costly resize events as the terminal's buffer is always in sync with its size.
- Since the restore is relatively quick, it's all handled in a single frame. This means that precious CPU time isn't wasted on rendering the partially restored terminal which slows things further.

How much of a speed up this provides depends on many factors like the number of terminals, hardware, terminal buffer size, what was happening in the terminal. A rough estimate of restoring a full terminal buffer should yield an approximate speedup of 5-10x.

We also published the new [xterm-headless](http://npmjs.com/package/xterm-headless) package on npm, so you can even leverage this work in your own project.

## Debugging

### Legacy node debuggers are gone
TODO@connor

### Watch: set value of expressions

Now it is possible to set values of expressions in the WATCH view using the "Set Value" action in the context menu.

Please note that debug extensions have to opt into this feature in order to make this action available.
For now, JS-debug, C# and C++ extensions support this, but we expect other debug extensions to follow soon.


![Shows WATCH view with the Set Value action selected in the context menu ](images/1_60/set-value.png)


### Minor UI improvements
* We now detect links for values also in Variables view, Watch view and the Debug Hover. When a variable's value is a link this will make it easier to follow that link by simply clicking on it.
* When starting another instance of a debug session that is already running we now show a modal confirmation dialog to prevent accidentally starting two sessions.
* Clicking on disabled breakpoint now enables the breakpoint instead of removing it.
* "Run To Cursor" now available in context menu of Breakpoint gutter
TODO@henning

### New settings
* New setting for warning on quit if running code
TODO@rob
* We have introduced `debug.console.acceptSuggestionOnEnter`, a setting that controls whether suggestions should be accepted on `enter` in the debug console. `enter` is also used to evaluate whatever is typed in the debug console, so this should allow users to better control what happens when pressing `enter`.


## Notebooks

### Links between markdown cells

Notebooks now supports links between markdown cells:

![Clickable links to the headers of other notebook cells](images/1_60/notebook-links.gif)

You can create a link to a header in a markdown cell using:

```md
[Link text](#header-slug)
```

`header-slug` is the lowercase text of the header with any spaces or special characters replaced with `-`. The above link for example will go to the header `# Header Slug`.

### Performance improvements when dealing with large outputs

We've optimized how we deal with large outputs in notebooks to significantly improve performance.

Behind the scenes, VS Code stores notebook outputs as binary data using [Uint8Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array). Previously, when transferring output data between the extension host process and the renderer process, we first converted it to an array of number values and then serialized this array to JSON.

To understand why this is bad for performance, consider a notebook that outputs the text: `Hello Code!`. This is stored internally as the `Uint8Array`:

```js
new Uint8Array([72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 67, 111, 100, 101, 33])
```

That data is 11 bytes long. However our old implementation would then convert the binary data to the JSON string:

```js
"[72,101,108,108,111,32,67,111,100,101,33]"
```

That string is 41 bytes long, which is over 3.5x times the size of our original data! That's a lot extra bytes we now have to transfer and the receiver now also has to parse that string as JSON to convert it back into a `Uint8Array`. This parsing can become a big bottleneck for notebook outputs that are 10s of MB in size.

With our fix however, we now keep notebook outputs as binary data while transferring them. You can read more about the details of how this was implemented [in the pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/130452).

This fix significantly improves both loading of notebooks with large outputs saved into them, as well as improving performance when notebooks generate large outputs during execution.

## Preview Features

### Quotes support in the "Search by file name" quick pick

This iteration, we have added the ability to exclude fuzzy search results from the "Search by file name" quick pick (typically accessed by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on Windows & Linux and <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on macOS).

Scenarios where this shines:

* When a query is only a few characters
![Query with only 2 characters yields more accurate results](images/1_60/quotes-query-pick.gif)

* If you want to reduce the "clutter" of the results
![Results disappear when adding quotes](images/1_60/quotes-query-pieces.gif)

We are liking the quoting experience and it feels intuitive to use thanks to search engines using a similar mechanism but we'd love your feedback. We are also considering other approaches [which are being discussed in issue #131421 on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/131431). Please let us know you're thoughts.

## Extension authoring

### Short title for commands

The [`commands`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.commands)-contribution point allows extensions to define UI-properties for commands, like title, category, or icon. Menus on the other hand are "places" that display commands and for that they select some or all UI-properties. For instance, some menus render only icons while others render titles or category plus title. Sometimes it is hard to come up with a command title that works equally well for global and local menus, e.g the command palette needs more words than a context menu.

For that a new `shortTitle`-property exists. It allows commands to provide a shorter title that works well in context, like _"Notebook: Clear All Cell Output"_ in the command palette vs _"Clear All"_ in the notebook toolbar.

### App Host added to environment namespace
The `.env` namespace has seen the addition of `appHost`. `appHost` allows extension developers better granularity when determining the environment which VS Code is hosted in. Examples include desktop, codespaces, and github.dev

### `RendererContext.isTrusted` for notebook renderers

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Debugger Extensions

### new 'managedByParent' property on 'DebugSessionOptions'
TODO@andre

### VS Code honors the "showUser" property for DAP launch and attach

When a `launch` or `attach` request fail VS Code will now honor the `showUser` property sent with the response from the debug adapter. If the `showUser` property is provided and is false VS Code will **not** show a modal dialog with the error. In case the `showUser` property is missing or is `true` VS Code will behave as before and will show the error dialog.

For other requests there is no change, if the `showUser` is `true` the error will be shown using a notification. Otherwsie nothing will be shown to the user.

### VS Code does not register breakpoints for "nodebug" debug sessions
TODO@andre

### VS Code now supports DAP's `setExpression`
TODO@andre

### Suppress addition of the 'Open launch.json' button when the error is adding its own command-type button

Debug Adapter Protocol permits the [Message](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/specification#Types_Message) of an [ErrorResponse](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/specification#Base_Protocol_ErrorResponse) to return a `url` where additional information about the message can be found, and a `urlLabel` that is presented to the user as the UI for opening the url. When VS Code shows the message to the user in a modal dialog a button is shown captioned with the `urlLabel`. Prior to this release, VS Code would also add a button captioned 'Open launch.json'. That button is no longer added if the `url` of the message uses the 'command' scheme, for example `command:myExtension.fixError`.


## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [vscode.proposed.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Support for type hierarchy

There is an API proposal for a [`TypeHierarchyProvider`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/75f509fa8ac66f0909f9958de17b9e0a8a10a937/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L2808-L2808) which allows extensions to provide super- and sub-types for symbols. The API is ready to be tried.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

### Create terminals anywhere

The [proposed terminal location API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/6d2920473c6f13759c978dd89104c4270a83422d/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L929-L967) allows creating both terminal splits in the panel as well as in the editor area.

### Query and event for whether a terminal has been "interacted with"

A [new proposed `Terminal.state` and `window.onDidChangeTerminalState`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/6d2920473c6f13759c978dd89104c4270a83422d/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L890-L927) allows querying whether a terminal has been "interacted with", this essentially means has any data been sent to the process which could happen for numerous reasons with the main one being keyboard input.

### Buttons in QuickPickItems

We now have a proposed API for [adding and handling buttons in `QuickPickItem`s](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/ecc7fdac9014976109db45db3143261a5795169d/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L2889-L2899). We hope this will enable a ton of rich user interactions in a familar place, the quick pick.

![buttons in QuickPickItems](images/1_60/quick-pick-buttons.png)

Please try it out and let us know what you think. One thing to note is that there is [currently a known issue around the scroll position](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/109969) of the quick pick which we think will be amplified by this new proposed API. We are working on the right set of APIs to address this issue. Please let us know your thoughts by [engaging in the issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/109969).
