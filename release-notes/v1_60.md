## Workbench

### Locked editor groups

With the introduction of [terminals in the editor area](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_58#_terminals-in-the-editor-area), we received more and more reports of users getting frustrated that a terminal editor would get replaced with a file editor too easily and by accident. By default, files will always open in the active editor group and thus when a terminal was active, a file would open and as such hide the terminal.

Locked editor groups provide a new way of handling this issue not only for terminals but for any editor. If you have more than one editor group opened, you can now lock it, either using one of the new commands or from the "..." overflow menu:

![Locked Editor Group](images/1_60/locked-editor-group.png)

Locked groups behave different to other unlocked groups like so:
* new editors will not open in a locked group unless explicitly moved there by the user (e.g. via drag and drop)
* if an editor skips a locked group for opening it will either open in the most recently used unlocked group or create a new group to the side of the locked one
* the locked state of an editor group is persisted and restored across restarts
* you can lock empty groups as well allowing for some more stable editor layouts
* a locked group indicates as such with a lock icon in the action toolbar (top right)

![Locked Editor Group Layout](images/1_60/locked-editor-layout.png)

See the following demo of how locked editor groups behave in action. Even though the markdown preview is active, new files that open will open in the left editor group:

![Locked Editor Group](images/1_60/locked-editor-group.gif)

New commands that were added for this feature are:
* `workbench.action.experimentalLockEditorGroup`
* `workbench.action.experimentalUnlockEditorGroup`
* `workbench.action.experimentalToggleEditorGroupLock`

A new context key `activeEditorGroupLocked` can be used to conditionally bind commands depending on the locked state of a group.

**Note:** the associated setting and commands are experimental until we have finalized the design of locked editor groups. We are curious for feedback on this new feature, so please do not hesitate to [report issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).

### New `workbench.editor.experimentalAutoLockGroups` to auto-lock an editor group

Building on top of the new locked editor groups concept, the new `workbench.editor.experimentalAutoLockGroups` setting allows to enlist editors that should lock a group automatically when they open. This only applies to when the editor is the first to open in an otherwise empty or new group.

Terminals are configured by default to cause a new group to lock automatically. Even though the terminal is active, the selected file from the terminal will open in the left editor group:

![Auto Locked Editor Group](images/1_60/auto-locked-editor-group.gif)

If you want markdown previews to lock a group automatically, you can add `mainThreadWebview-markdown.preview: true` to the setting.

**Note:** In the next milestones we will work on improving the settings UX to be able to pick editors without having to know their identifiers.

**Note:** the associated setting and commands are experimental until we have finalized the design of locked editor groups. We are curious for feedback on this new feature, so please do not hesitate to [report issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).

### Terminal editor confirmation dialog

The dialog presented when closing a terminal editor that is marked as dirty is now specific for the terminal editor and will no longer offer a way to "Save" the terminal.

![Dirty Terminal Editor Confirmation Dialog](images/1_60/dirty-terminal-dialog.png)

### Keep editors open instead of closing when they fail to restore

So far, when an editor failed to restore after reload of the window or restart of the application, the editor would automatically close until an editor was found that succeeds to load.

This behaviour can lead to frustrating results where a carefully created editor layout and arrangement is going away due to editors closing.

With this release, an editor that was once successfully opened will not close, even when it fails to restore. The editor indicates the problem and offers a way to retry the operation:

![Keep Editors Open](images/1_60/keep-editor-open.png)

## Terminal

### Custom rendering of box drawing and block element characters

Box drawing and block element characters now use pixel-perfect custom glyphs instead of using the font when GPU acceleration is on (`terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration`). This means for example that boxes are drawn without gaps, even if you set line height or letter spacing in the terminal.

TODO@Tyriar before/after image

Here is an example of the terminal app zenith which shows the box drawing characters around sections as well as block elements for the charts:

TODO@Tyriar image

This can be disabled with `"terminal.integrated.customGlyphs": false`.

### Faster reconnection after reloading the window

Previously when reloading it could take up to 300ms parse the state of a terminal's buffer and there was a possibility of corruption. For several busy terminals this can quickly add up! The method of restoring the buffer has changed from recording a large number of recent raw terminal events on the [pty host](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_54#_new-terminal-process-layout) to maintaining a headless terminal frontend on the pty host and writing all data to that. This comes with several benefits:

- The amount of scrollback to restore can be fine tuned, the default is now 100 which is a good balance between speed and the amount of data. The scrollback amount can be changed with the `terminal.integrated.persistentSessionScrollback` setting.
- Thanks to [xterm.js'](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js) fast parser this should have minimal impact on CPU and reduce overall memory usage on the pty host.
- Terminal modes are now restored explicitly which could potentially get missed before, causing buffer corruption.
- There is no longer the need to replay costly resize events as the terminal's buffer is always in sync with its size.
- Since the restore is relatively quick, it's all handled in a single frame. This means that precious CPU time isn't wasted on rendering the partially restored terminal which slows things further.

How much of a speed up this provides depends on many factors like the number of terminals, hardware, terminal buffer size, what was happening in the terminal. A rough estimate of restoring a full terminal buffer should yield an approximate speedup of 5-10x.

We also published the new [xterm-headless](http://npmjs.com/package/xterm-headless) package on npm, so you can even leverage this work in your own project.

## Debugging

### Legacy node debuggers are gone
TODO@connor

### Watch: allow to set value of expressions
TODO@isidor (user view - ext author view: see below)

### minor UI improvements
* detecting links in Variables, Watch and Debug Hover
TODO@isidorn
* Warning before starting another instance of the same debug session #127721
TODO@isidorn
* click on disabled breakpoint enables it instead of removing it #125904
TODO@isidorn
* "Run To Cursor" now available in context menu of Breakpoint gutter

TODO@isidorn

## Extension authoring

### Short title for commands

The [`commands`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.commands)-contribution point allows extensions to define UI-properties for commands, like title, category, or icon. Menus on the other hand are "places" that display commands and for that they select some or all UI-properties. For instance, some menus render only icons while others render titles or category plus title. Sometimes it is hard to come up with a command title that works equally well for global and local menus, e.g the command palette needs more words than a context menu.

For that a new `shortTitle`-property exists. It allows commands to provide a shorter title that works well in context, like _"Notebook: Clear All Cell Output"_ in the command palette vs _"Clear All"_ in the notebook toolbar.

### App Host added to environment namespace
The `.env` namespace has seen the addition of `appHost`. `appHost` allows extension developers better granularity when determining the environment which VS Code is hosted in. Examples include desktop, codespaces, and github.dev

## Debugger Extensions

### new 'managedByParent' property on 'DebugSessionOptions'
TODO@andre

### VS Code now honors the "showUser" property on DAP requests
TODO@isidor

### VS Code does not register breakpoints for "nodebug" debug sessions
TODO@andre

### VS Code now supports DAP's `setExpression`
TODO@andre

### Suppress addition of the 'Open launch.json' button when the error is adding its own command-type button
DAP permits the [Message](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/specification#Types_Message) of an [ErrorResponse](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/specification#Base_Protocol_ErrorResponse) to return a `url` where additional information about the message can be found, and a `urlLabel` that is presented to the user as the UI for opening the url. When VS Code shows the message to the user in a modal dialog a button is shown captioned with the `urlLabel`. Prior to this release, VS Code would also add a button captioned 'Open launch.json'. That button is no longer added if the `url` of the message uses the 'command' scheme, for example `command:myExtension.fixError`.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [vscode.proposed.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Support for type hierarchy

There is an API proposal for a [`TypeHierarchyProvider`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/75f509fa8ac66f0909f9958de17b9e0a8a10a937/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L2808-L2808) which allows extensions to provide super- and sub-types for symbols. The API is ready to be tried.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.
