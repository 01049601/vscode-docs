# January 2023 (version 1.75)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.75 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/170413)** - Review what's planned for the January milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22January+2023%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

<!-- Workbench stuff  -->

## Workbench

### Default type navigation mode

The new `workbench.list.typeNavigationMode` setting allows you to configure the default type navigation mode for lists. When set to `trigger`, the list will only go into type navigation mode once the `list.triggerTypeNavigation` command is run.

### Nushell environment resolution support

[Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) is now supported whenever user environment is resolved.

### New `VSCODE_RESOLVING_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable

When resolving user environment, VS Code will now set a new environment variable `VSCODE_RESOLVING_ENVIRONMENT` to `1`. This is useful for user scripts (eg `.bashrc`) that need to know whether they are being run in the context of resolving the user environment.

### Setting to configure shell environment resolution timeout

A new setting `application.shellEnvironmentResolutionTimeout` allows to increase the timeout for resolving the shell environment when that is required. By default, VS Code will wait up to 10 seconds for the environment to resolve but in certain cases with more complex shell setups, this was often not enough.

Refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_resolving-shell-environment-fails for more information on this topic.

### New confirmation to open large files

To prevent accidental opening of very large files, especially in remote environments where this might have an actual cost due to network transfer, a confirmation is shown before opening the actual file. The limit can be tweaked via the new `workbench.editorLargeFileConfirmation` setting and has different defaults based on opening local files vs. remote files.

### File watcher supports `files.watcherExclude` glob patterns natively

The `files.watcherExclude` setting supports glob patterns for powerful exclusion rules for the underlying file watcher. In this milestone we [contributed](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/watcher/pull/106) support for glob patterns as exclusions to the underlying file watcher for more efficient resource usage, especially on Linux.

## Editor

<!-- Color decorators limit -->

<!-- Find UI improvement, Command: Go to X of Y in Editor Find -->

## Notebooks

<!-- Notebook Overview Ruler show cell editor warning/problems now -->

<!-- Notebook Diff change navigation -->

## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Auto-select environment when VSCode is launched from an activated terminal

If a user launches VS Code via terminal with a conda or virtual environment already activated, VS Code now detects that and then either auto-selects the environment itself, or asks the user if they would like to make that environment their selected one; depending on the environment.

### Cell editor polish

VS Code can now use all editor line number options when `notebook.lineNumbers` is turned on. For example, with `"notebook.lineNumbers": "on"` and `"editor.lineNumbers": "relative"`, relative line numbers are displayed in cell editor.

### Cell commands

* Join Selected Cells (`notebook.cell.joinSelected`)

## Engineering

### Utility Process for Extension Host

The utility process usage for extension host that is required for [process sandboxing](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/11/28/vscode-sandbox) is now enabled by default. There is still a setting (`extensions.experimental.useUtilityProcess`), which we will remove soon.

### Performance testing via command line

We introduced node modules that enable a set of performance tests from the command line. This helps us measuring performance regressions quickly. You can run such a performance test with the help of the `vscode-bisect` module. Just run `npx vscode-bisect --help` for how to operate this tool.

## Notable fixes

* [165123](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/165123) Allow to open a diff editor with two untitled sides
* [153786](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/153786) Have a command to open either side of a diff editor
