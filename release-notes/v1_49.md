<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the August 1.49 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the August milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[August iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/104735)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22August+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Engineering

### Web Playground moved to a separate repository

The extension that drives our [online web playground](https://vscode-web-test-playground.azurewebsites.net/) as well as `yarn web` when running out of sources moved into it's own [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-web-playground).

### Web Playground support for different versions

Our [online web playground](https://vscode-web-test-playground.azurewebsites.net/) is now capable of running not only the latest insiders version of VSCode, but also the stable version or any released version by commit. New query parameters allow to drive this:
* `quality=<stable|insider>`
* `commit=<commit-sha>`

**Note:** if you specify a `commit` you must also specify it's associated `quality`.

### Minimal sandboxed workbench

We continue to explore enabling Electron's `sandbox` option in VSCode. During this milestone, we worked on allowing to bring up a minimal VSCode instance that is fully sandboxed by shimming a lot of the internals that today still require node.js access. This will be a multi-milestone journey and progress can be tracked at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/92164.

## Notable fixes

* [82604](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82604): Web: editor does not provide a "Paste" action
* [105481](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/105481): macOS: detect high contrast theme
* [101110](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/101110): Allow to configure workbench.editor.restoreViewState per language
* [103052](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/103052): Order of files in "Search files by name" results is incorrect
