# August 2020 (version 1.49)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the August 1.49 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the August milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[August iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/104735)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22August+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Editor

### Only Format Modified Ranges

When contributing to another project, "Format on Save" and "Format Document" can get in your way because they format lines that you have not changed. This makes pull requests large and is often unwanted. There is new feature to help with that:

* We added a new command "Format Modified Lines" which allows to manually format new and changes lines
* There is a new setting `editor.formatOnSaveMode` which makes "Format on Save" only format modified lines

Note, that modifications are defined by your source control provider, e.g changes in git, and that without changes in source control no modified lines are formatted. The quick diff indicator is a reliable hint for what lines will be formatted.

This also requires a formatter that supports to format a portion of a document - which popular formatter do.

### Format Multiple Selections

Also, the "Format Selection" command is now multi-cursor aware. Select multiple lines or statements, trigger "Format Selection", and you are set.

## Engineering

### Web Playground moved to a separate repository

The extension that drives our [online web playground](https://vscode-web-test-playground.azurewebsites.net/) as well as `yarn web` when running out of sources moved into it's own [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-web-playground).

### Web Playground support for different versions

Our [online web playground](https://vscode-web-test-playground.azurewebsites.net/) is now capable of running not only the latest insiders version of VSCode, but also the stable version or any released version by commit. New query parameters allow to drive this:
* `quality=<stable|insider>`
* `commit=<commit-sha>`

**Note:** if you specify a `commit` you must also specify it's associated `quality`.

### Minimal sandboxed workbench

We continue to explore enabling Electron's `sandbox` option in VSCode. During this milestone, we worked on allowing to bring up a minimal VSCode instance that is fully sandboxed by shimming a lot of the internals that today still require node.js access. This will be a multi-milestone journey and progress can be tracked at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/92164.

### Making VS Code Trusted Types compliant

We have started an effort to make VS Code "Trusted Types" compliant. The goal is to prevent DOM-based cross site scripting vulnerabilities. Learn more about trusted types here: https://web.dev/trusted-types/, follow our process here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/103699

* [101110](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/101110): Allow to configure workbench.editor.restoreViewState per language
