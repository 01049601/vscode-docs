# August 2020 (version 1.49)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the August 1.49 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the August milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[August iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/104735)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22August+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Screencast mode keyboard indicator timeout
The new `screencastMode.keyboardOverlayTimeout` settings allows the user to customize the time in milliseconds for the keyboard indicator.

### Screencast mode mouse indicator color and size
The new `screencastMode.mouseIndicatorColor`, and `screencastMode.mouseIndicatorSize` settings allows the use to customize the mouse indicator color and size.

## Editor

### Only Format Modified Ranges

When contributing to another project, "Format on Save" and "Format Document" can get in your way because they format lines that you have not changed. This makes pull requests large and is often unwanted. There is new feature to help with that:

* We added a new command "Format Modified Lines" which allows to manually format new and changes lines
* There is a new setting `editor.formatOnSaveMode` which makes "Format on Save" only format modified lines

Note, that modifications are defined by your source control provider, e.g changes in git, and that without changes in source control no modified lines are formatted. The quick diff indicator is a reliable hint for what lines will be formatted.

![Format Modified](images/1_49/format_modified.gif)

This also requires a formatter that supports to format a portion of a document - which popular formatter do.

### Format Multiple Selections

Also, the "Format Selection" command is now multi-cursor aware. Select multiple lines or statements, trigger "Format Selection", and you are set.


### Find widget cursor move on type

Previously when you type in the Find Wiget input box, VS Code will automatically search and then move the cursor to the nearest find result. Now you can control if the cursor should jump to the find matches while typing by configuring `editor.find.cursorMoveOnType`. When disabled, VS Code will only move the cursor when you press Enter/Shift+Enter.

## Debugging

### Debug console filter
TODO @isidorn

### UX improvements
* When debugging multiple sessions, we now only render the arrow in the glyph margin for the focussed session. This should make it easier for users to distinguish which editor call stack decoration belongs to the debug session the user is interested in.
* Large stack frames now show a "Load All Stack Frames" button to load all the remaining stack frames. Previously this was a "Load More Stack Frames" button which would require multiple clicks for very large stack traces.

## Contributions to extensions

### Notebooks

**Improve cell execution order label discoverability**

Previously, the cell execute button would take the place of the execution order label when hovering or selecting a cell. This made it impossible to see the execution order label while executing a cell. We have moved it to sit below the execute button, aligned with the base of the editor. This should make it easier to find. (In this example, it's the `[6]`):

![cell execution order](./images/1_49/cell_execution_order.png)

**Customize cell appearance**

We've added two settings that let users customize the cell appearance:

- `notebook.cellToolbarLocation`: Whether the toolbar should be shown on the left, the right, or hidden
- `notebook.showCellStatusBar`: Whether or not the cell status bar should be visible

**Cell status bar item contributions**

It's now possible for extensions to contribute custom items to the cell status bar, similarly to the VS Code status bar. These items can be buttons that trigger commands, or just plain text items. As an example, our Github issues notebook extension now contributes the "Open x results" command as a status bar item:

![cell statusbar item](./images/1_49/cell_status_bar_item.png)

**Enhanced Text Diff Editor**

In this release we added a new type of diff editor for viewing changes in notebook documents. Traditinal notebooks are stored in JSON format, which is easy to parse but not effective on diffing since most diff algorithms on text files are line based. To improve this experience, we built an enhanced diff editor which is aware of notebook document and cells concept to help users quickly identify what cell content or metadata are changed.

## Extension authoring

### Terminal link providers

The terminal link provider API is now stable. This API enables language/lint extensions to handle more obscure link formats that are not already supported and even support language-specific behavior.

Take the following Java exception for example:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 9
    at MyProgram.main(MyFile.java:10)
```

Using terminal link providers it is now possible to have a link for `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` that goes to API docs and create links for the symbols `MyProgram` or `main`.

The following example implementation creates a link for the first instance of the word `"test"` on each line:

```ts
window.registerTerminalLinkProvider({
    provideTerminalLinks: (context, token) => {
        // Detect the first instance of the word "test" if it exists and linkify it
        const startIndex = (context.line as string).indexOf('test');
        if (startIndex === -1) {
            return [];
        }
        // Return an array of link results, this example only returns a single link
        return [
            {
                startIndex,
                length: 'test'.length,
                tooltip: 'Show a notification',
                // You can return data in this object to access inside handleTerminalLink
                data: 'Example data'
            }
        ];
    },
    handleTerminalLink: (link: any) => {
        vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Link activated (data = ${link.data})`);
    }
});
```

### Debug Extension APIs

* Named Pipes DA
TODO @weinand

* Stopping debug sessions
TODO @weinand
VS Code uses the function `vscode.debug.startDebugging` for starting debug sessions. In this milestone, we introduced the matching function `vscode.debug.stopDebugging` to stop a specific session (or all sessions). With this new API, it is no longer necessary to use the less predictable **Debug: Stop** command (command ID: `workbench.action.debug.stop`) which only stops the "active" debug session.

* In this milestone we provide official extension API for "Run without Debugging": a new property `noDebug` has been added to the `DebugSessionOptions` of the `debug.startDebugging` function. `noDebug` controls whether the session about to start should run with or without debugging. When the `noDebug` property is missing, the value from the parent session (if there is one) is used. If there is no parent session, the value 'false' is assumed for a missing `noDebug` property.

* In order to make the CALL STACK view less crowded in common cases, we have introduced a feature to hide a parent debug session node if it only has a single child session. This feature is called "compact mode" and is available through a new optional `compact` property on the `DebugSessionOptions` of the `debug.startDebugging` function. If `compact` is true, the parent of the newly created debug session will be hidden in the CALL STACK view as long as it only has a single child.
If `compact` is false or missing, the parent node stays visible (which is the current behavior).

* Expose DAP IDs of breakpoints in vscode API
TODO @weinand

* Before a debug session starts  `preLaunchTask` is now launched after the `resolveDebugConfiguration` call and before the `resolveDebugConfigurationWithSubstitutedVariables`.

## Engineering

### Web Playground moved to a separate repository

The extension that drives our [online web playground](https://vscode-web-test-playground.azurewebsites.net/) as well as `yarn web` when running out of sources moved into it's own [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-web-playground).

### Web Playground support for different versions

Our [online web playground](https://vscode-web-test-playground.azurewebsites.net/) is now capable of running not only the latest insiders version of VSCode, but also the stable version or any released version by commit. New query parameters allow to drive this:
* `quality=<stable|insider>`
* `commit=<commit-sha>`

**Note:** if you specify a `commit` you must also specify it's associated `quality`.

### Minimal sandboxed workbench

We continue to explore enabling Electron's `sandbox` option in VSCode. During this milestone, we worked on allowing to bring up a minimal VSCode instance that is fully sandboxed by shimming a lot of the internals that today still require node.js access. This will be a multi-milestone journey and progress can be tracked at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/92164.

### Making VS Code Trusted Types compliant

We have started an effort to make VS Code "Trusted Types" compliant. The goal is to prevent DOM-based cross site scripting vulnerabilities. Learn more about trusted types here: https://web.dev/trusted-types/, follow our process here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/103699
