# February 2023 (version 1.76)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.76 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22February+2023%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Accessibility

### Context specific tab focus mode

The **Toggle Tab Key Moves Focus** command is useful for determining whether the workbench or editor/terminal receive `kbsytle(Tab)` key input.

We have added `editor.tabFocusMode` and `terminal.integrated.tabFocusMode` settings to allow users to control this by default.

### Improved error audio cue responsiveness

The `audioCues.lineHasError` audio cue now plays during character navigation so that screen reader users have improved insight into where the errors are in the editor.

### Terminal accessible buffer improvements

Last iteration, we introduced the terminal accessible buffer, which provides screen reader users access to the terminal contents via the **Terminal: Focus Accessible Buffer** command.

This iteration, we've improved the accessible buffer by adding selection and link support, making it read-only, and using shell integration insights to limit output to only the important terminal content - the command that was run, the exit code if any, and the output. We plan to allow configuring this next iteration.

### Terminal command failure audio cue

When a command exits with a non-zero code in a terminal with shell integration, sighted users can glance at the command decoration to quickly understand this. To convey this information to screen reader users, VS Code now plays `audioCues.terminalCommandFailed`.

### Screen reader shell integration support on Windows

Shell integration was previously disabled when a screen reader was detected on Windows due to problems with PowerShell support in this context. We have determined that this is no longer an issue in most cases, so have enabled it.

### Terminal accessible help additions

Discussions with the screen reader community have yielded additions to the **Terminal Accessibilty Help** dialog (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.showAccessibilityHelp)`).

## Profiles

## Workbench

### Moveable Explorer view

The Explorer view (`kb(workbench.view.explorer)`), like many other views in VS Code, can now be moved into the secondary side bar or the bottom panel to allow for further workbench customization.

### Fixed-width centered layout

The centered layout **View: Toggle Central Layout** command (`workbench.action.toggleCenteredLayout`) now has a fixed-width layout option. This option is enabled with the new `workbench.editor.centeredLayoutFixedWidth` setting. When enabled and centered layout is active, the editor will be centered and attempt to maintain its width across window and panel resizes.

### Multiple quick diffs

With the introduction of the proposed [multiple quick diff API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/release-notes/v1_75.md#quick-diff), multiple extensions can provide a quick diff. When there are multiple quick diffs in a file, you'll now see a dropdown to choose which diff base to view:

![Multiple quick diffs](images/1_76/multiple-quick-diff.png)

### Comments

The **Comments** view has a new **Expand All** command to go with the existing **Collapse All**. The gutter icon for unresolved comments is now the same icon that is used in the **Comments** view.

## Editor

### JSONC document sorting

It is now possible to sort JSONC (JSON documents with comments) files by key. To use this feature, select **JSON: Sort document** from the Command Palette.

## Terminal

## Source Control

## Notebooks

### Notebook renderer performance diagnostics

When running notebook cells, some notebook output renderers may take a long time to render. To help identify these renderers, we've added some diagnostics to the hover in the notebook cell Status bar. This view will show the time it took to for each renderer to execute and the execution time. Additionally, the links in the hover will open the issue reporter with the renderer's name and execution time pre-filled so that you can easily file an issue if you find the renderer is taking too long to execute.

![image showing the cell Status bar hover with renderer execution times](./images/1_76/notebook-renderer-performance-diagnostics.png)

## Debugging

## Languages

### Git

We've adopted a new Git grammar, which provides syntax highlighting for Git commit message files. The new grammar has better support for languages other than English.

## Extensions

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment. <!-- Highlights of this release include: -->

<!-- * TBD -->

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_76.md).

### Remote indicator

This milestone we made several usability improvements to the remote indicator (visible in the lower left of the Status bar):

1. There is now a default keybinding to open the remote indicator menu: `kb(workbench.action.remote.showMenu)`.

   <video src="images/1_76/remote-indicator.mp4" placeholder="images/1_76/remote-indicator.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Opening the remote indicator menu with the new default keybinding">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
   </video>

2. We reduced our remote extensions' contributions to the remote indicator to make it easy to view all actions for connecting to a remote window at a glance.
   * Basic actions for opening a remote window are now always available in the remote indicator, so you can discover actions to connect to another remote even when you are already in a remote window.
   * Most actions for configuring or getting started with a remote have moved from the remote indicator menu to the command palette to conserve space in the remote indicator.

3. The **Install Additional Remote Extensions** option in the remote indicator now points to a list of curated Remote Development extensions and is hidden from the remote indicator menu if all such extensions are already installed.

### Remote Repositories

This milestone, we introduced the `Browse & Edit Remote Repositories without Cloning` walkthrough in the [Remote Repositories](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-repositories) extension to help you search, edit and create quick commits in GitHub and Azure Repos without cloning locally.

You can also check out the [Remote Repositories tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/06/10/remote-repositories) to help you get started.

## VS Code for the Web

This milestone we have added experimental readonly support for [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)-tracked files hosted in GitHub and Azure Repos repositories on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev).

   <video src="images/1_76/web-git-lfs.mp4" placeholder="images/1_76/web-git-lfs.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Viewing a markdown preview of a file containing Git LFS image references in vscode.dev">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
   </video>

When you view a file in a GitHub or Azure Repos repository, based on your `.gitattributes` configuration, we detect whether the file is LFS-tracked and needs to be fetched from GitHub's or Azure Repos's LFS servers.

You can also use the [GitHub Repositories](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.remotehub) and [Azure Repos](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-repos) extensions with VS Code Desktop to browse repositories containing Git LFS-tracked files without cloning.

This behavior can be disabled with the following settings:

* `"githubRepositories.experimental.lfs.read.enabled": false`
* `"azureRepos.experimental.lfs.read.enabled": false`

Note that we do not yet support committing Git LFS-tracked files, and [github.dev](https://github.dev) does not yet have Git LFS read support.

## Contributions to extensions

### Jupyter

#### IPyWidgets

Version `8` of [IPyWidgets](https://pypi.org/project/ipywidgets/#description) is now supported. Python Widgets relying on `IPyWidgets 7.*` will continue work, as both versions `7.*` and `8.*` are supported.

### Python

#### Improved IntelliSense support for pytest with Pylance

The [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) extension now has powerful features that can help you work more efficiently and effectively when writing and maintaining clear, concise, and easy to understand tests with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org):

* Support for completions, **Go to Definition**, **Find All References**, and **Rename Symbol** (F2) for pytest fixtures and parameterized arguments.
* Type annotation support for pytest parameters through inlay hints (enabled by the ``"python.analysis.inlayHints.pytestParameters"`` setting) and through Code Actions.
* Type inference of parameterized pytest arguments, based on the parameter values provided to the decorator.

The short video below highlights these new pytest features:

      Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
</video>

#### Interactive Window kernel selection

Auto-selecting a kernel for the Interactive Window was modified to work better with the new kernel picker UI. The current active interpreter will be used unless another kernel was previously chosen for an Interactive Window in that workspace, in which case the previously selected kernel will be used.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. Highlights include:

* Permalink rendering in the PR description and in comments.
* Re-requesting reviews from the description page.
* Quick diffs for files in a checked-out PR.

Check out the [changelog for the 0.60.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0600) release of the extension to see the other highlights.

## Preview features

### Rich content notebook search

Global search now supports showing results from notebooks as they would be displayed in the notebook editor. Enable `search.experimental.notebookSearch` to try this out, and let us know about any bugs that you run into! This currently only supports searching cell inputs and Markdown sources in cells.

## Extension authoring

## Link support in InputBox prompts and validation messages

This iteration, we introduced support for links in `InputBox` prompts and validation messages. In those strings, you can now use the following syntax to create links:
```
[link text](link target)
```
The link target can be a URL or a command ID. When the user clicks on the link, the link target will be opened in the browser or executed as a command, respectively.

Example:
```ts
const result = await vscode.window.showInputBox({
   prompt: 'Please enter a valid email address [more info](https://aka.ms/vscode-email-validation)',
   validateInput: text => {
      if (text.indexOf('@') === -1) {
         return 'Please enter a valid email address, [more info](https://aka.ms/vscode-email-validation)';
      }
      return undefined;
   }
});
```

Which will result in the following prompt:

![prompt contains a link which is underlined](images/1_76/quickpick-prompt-links.png)

and the following validation message:

![validation message contains a link which is underlined](images/1_76/quickpick-validation-links.png)

_Theme: [Panda Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/tinkertrain.theme-panda))_

This behavior works for both `showInputBox` and `createInputBox` APIs.

## Infomation Diagnostic for '*' activation event

When an extension uses the `*` (star) activation event, it will be activated while VS Code is in the process of starting up. This can cause a delay in the startup time of VS Code. To help extension authors understand the impact of using the `*` activation event, we have added an information diagnostic that will be shown when an extension uses the `*` activation event. The diagnostic will be shown in the Problems view and will also be shown in the extension editor:

![diagnostic for * activation event](images/1_76/star-activation.png)

For more information about `*` (star) activation, please see the [Activation Events](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/activation-events#Start-up) documentation.

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### OpenDialogOptions allowUIResources

Extensions that are aware that they are running in a remote extension host can use `allowUIResources` to cause the **Show local** button to display in open file dialogs. Extensions that use `allowUIResources` should always check the scheme of the URI that's returned.

### Tooltips for QuickPickItems

This iteration we are introducing a new proposed API for a `tooltip` property for `QuickPickItem`s. This property allows you to specify a tooltip for each item in a quick pick. The tooltip will be displayed when the user hovers over the item or it can be toggled with `Ctrl+Space`.

Example:
```ts
await vscode.window.showQuickPick([
   {
      label: 'label',
      tooltip: 'tooltip',
   },
   {
      label: 'label2',
      tooltip: new vscode.MarkdownString('tooltip2 [link](https://github.com)'),
   }
], {
   placeHolder: 'placeholder'
});
```

Which will result in the following Quick Pick:

![Quick Pick with tooltips](images/1_76/quickpick-tooltip.mp4)

_Theme: [Panda Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/tinkertrain.theme-panda))_

Obviously, this is a very simple example that doesn't need a tooltip. Tooltips are useful when you want to provide long descriptions that might have multiple lines or links to additional resources.

We think that this API is a good addition to the quick pick API and we are looking forward to your feedback.
