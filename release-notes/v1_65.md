# February 2022 (version 1.65)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.65 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/142359)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22February+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## VS Code for the Web

### Support to reopen local files and folders

The list of recently opened local files and folders is now functional when you access [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) or [insiders.vscode.dev](https://insiders.vscode.dev) with a browser that supports the [web file system access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API). Selecting a local file will open it in an editor and selecting a local folder will update the File Explorer to show its contents. You may be asked by the browser to confirm local file access before the contents are revealed.

## Notebooks

### Builtin output renderers update

We now move the builtin text, images, html and code renderers from the core to a builtin output renderer extension. With this change, we can now search text on these output types

## Extension authoring

## Language Status Items

We have finalized the API for language status items. This API allows to show language specific information for the active editor. This can be ambient information about the project or version but also errors and warnings.

![JSON language status linking to schema used for validation](./images/1_65/language-status.png)

The API resembles the status bar API and can be accessed via `vscode.languages.createLanguageStatusItem(...)`. A language status item should be created with a document selector so that VS Code can show and hide it whenever the active editor changes.

## Inlay Hints

The inlay hint provider API is now finalized. It allows to inlay additional information with source code. The capture below shows how TypeScript added an inlay hint for an inferred type.

![TypeScript inferred variable type shown as inlay hint](./images/1_65/inlay-hints.png)

The API is built around the `InlayHintsProvider`. It is asked to provide `InlayHint` objects which have a couple of interesting features

* an inlay hint can have a tooltip and a command
* the label of a hint can be composed of multiple parts which again can have tooltip and command
* a label parts can also have an associated source location which enabled language features like "Go To Definition" and friends for this part.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.


### Notebook aware document selectors

The `vscode.DocumentSelector`-type allows to associate language features like "Go to Definition" to specific documents. This drives the UI and also decides if the corresponding provider is asked for results. We have added a new API proposal that allows to also select notebook types, like `{ language: 'python', notebookType: 'jupyter-notebook'}` targets all python documents that are embedded in Jupyter notebooks. This is the [current proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/8a3b1f4c4c24064273efb3417a5c2e229ba78481/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.notebookDocumentSelector.d.ts) - give it a try and let us know what you think.


## Notable fixes

* [142462](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/142462) File writes can hang when write locks are not cleared up
