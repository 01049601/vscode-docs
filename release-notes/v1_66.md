# March 2022 (version 1.66)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.66 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[March iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/144519)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22March+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Local history

Local history of files is now available from the **Timeline** view. Depending on the configured settings, every time you save an editor, a new entry is added to the list:

![Local History](images/1_66/local-history.gif)

Each local history entry contains the full contents of the file at the time the entry was created and in certain cases can provide more semantic information (for example indicate refactorings).

From an entry you can:

* compare the changes to the local file or previous entry
* restore the contents
* delete or rename the entry

New global commands have been added to work with local history:

* `workbench.action.localHistory.create`: create a new history entry for the active file with a custom name
* `workbench.action.localHistory.deleteAll`: delete all history entries across all files
* `workbench.action.localHistory.restoreViaPicker`: find a history entry to restore across all files

A bunch of new settings have been introduced to work with local history:

* `workbench.localHistory.enabled`: enable or disable local history (default: `true`)
* `workbench.localHistory.maxFileSize`: a limit of file size to create a local history entry (default: `256kb`)
* `workbench.localHistory.maxFileEntries`: a limit of local history entries per file (default: `50`)
* `workbench.localHistory.exclude`: glob patterns for excluding certain files from local history
* `workbench.localHistory.mergeWindow`: interval in seconds during which the last entry in local file history is replaced with the entry that is being added (default `10s`)

The new filter action from the timeline toolbar allows you to enable or disable individual providers:

![Timeline Filter](images/1_66/timeline-filter.png)

**Note:** local history entries are stored in different locations depending on your use of VS Code. When opening local files, the entries are persisted in the local user data folder and when opening remote files they will be stored on the remote user data folder. When no file system is available (for example in certain cases when using VS Code for Web), entries are stored into IndexedDB.

### Primary notification buttons

The first button of a notification now appears with a primary color to distinguish from other buttons. This follows the same patterns as dialogs.

![Primary notification button](images/1_66/notification.png)

_Theme: [GitHub Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

### New context keys for editors

New context keys were added to figure out if an editor is first or last in an editor group:

* `activeEditorIsFirstInGroup`- Whether the active editor is the first one in its group.
* `activeEditorIsLastInGroup`- Whether the active editor is the last one in its group.

### Settings editor

**Language filter**

Users can now type `@lang:languageId` in the Settings editor search widget to view and edit all settings that can be configured
for the language with ID `languageId`. This way, users can view language-specific settings, also known as language overrides.

Note that these overrides remain configured until explicitly reset by clicking in the gear icon and resetting the setting.

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme)_

**Workspace and Folder settings preservation**

Workspace and folder settings in the Settings editor are now preserved until manually reset by the user. This change helps with cases where the user wants to explicitly specify a workspace setting value that is equal to the default value of a setting,
but is different from the user setting value. Previously, users had to open the workspace settings JSON file for that case.

![Screencap going through the scenario above](images/1_66/settings-editor-workspace-override.gif)

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme)_

### Default binary editor

A new setting, `workbench.editor.defaultBinaryEditor`, lets you circumvent the binary file warning and automatically open the editor type of your choosing when a binary file is detected. You can select the default binary editor from a dropdown in the Settings editor or via IntelliSense in `settings.json`.

## Terminal

### Display all find matches

When searching in the terminal, all instances of the search term will now be highlighted. The currently selected one will be as well and can be customized separately.

Fine tune the appearance of these with the color customizations prefixed by `terminal.findMatch`.

![A yellow border is shown around all matches except for the currently selected one, which has a red border.](images/1_66/find-matches.png)

### Scroll bar annotations

Annotations now appear in the scrollbar of the terminal to indicate points of interest in the buffer.

For example, find results have corresponding annotations in the scrollbar.

![](images/1_66/find-scrollbar.png)

When the preview feature of shell integration is enabled, an annotation is displayed in the scrollbar for each command that gets run.

![Commands are run and corresponding annotations appear in the scrollbar](images/1_66/command-annotations.png)

### Command navigation improvements

A little known feature that's been around for a while is the ability to quickly navigate between commands in the terminal. Originally this was based on when enter was pressed but now when shell integration is enabled it will be upgraded to use the insights we gain from that feature to more reliably identify the correct lines. Additionally, feedback is now shown when jumping between commands.

TODO: Gif

This feature can be accessed via the following keybindings:

- macOS: cmd+up/down
- Linux/Windows: ctrl+up/down (new)

Shift can be held to make selections.

### Copied text retains HTML styling

To copy rich text from the terminal, run the `Terminal: Copy text as HTML` command or use the terminal context menu entry `Copy text as HTML`.

## Editor

### Quick suggestions as inline completions

The `editor.quickSuggestions` setting now accepts `inline` as configuration value. When set to `inline`, quick suggestions (IntelliSense) don't display the suggestions widget when you type but show completions as ghosted text.

![Inline completions show and update as ypu type](images/1_66/inline-quick-suggest.gif)

_Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

### Snippet variables for cursor index

There are new snippet variables: `$CURSOR_INDEX` and `$CURSOR_NUMBER`. They evaluate to the index of the respective cursor. The latter starts at 1, the former at 0. The power of these variables is in its combination with multiple cursors.

For example, the snippet below will add an ordered list item for each cursor:

```json
"ordered_list": {
  "scope": "markdown",
  "prefix": "ol",
  "body": [
    "$CURSOR_NUMBER. $0"
  ],
  "description": "Add ordered list"
}
```

## VS Code for the Web

### Drag and drop folders into VS Code for the Web

You can now drag and drop local files and folders into a browser window opened on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) or [insiders.vscode.dev](https://insiders.vscode.dev) with a browser that supports the [web file system access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) to access the contents. This works both when dropping over the editor area as well as the explorer.

![Drop folder into vscode.dev](images/1_66/web-dnd.gif)

## Notebooks

### Find decorations on scroll bar

The find results in notebooks will now be rendered in the scroll bar

![Find decorations rendered in the scroll bar](images/1_66/notebook-find-scrollbar.gif)


## Contributions to extensions

### Python

**Changes to Interpreter display in status bar**

In order to be consistent with other languages, selected interpreter version is now moved towards the right side in the status bar beside the language status item **Python**. With the intention of cleaning up the status bar, it's now only displayed when a Python or a `settings.json` file is currently open.

![Interpreters info displayed towards right](images/1_66/active-interpreter-display.png)

## Preview features

### Terminal shell integration

Shell integration continued to see more improvements this release mainly in for form of reliability and improvements to the decorations which can be seen in the Terminal section above.

Here are the highlights:

- Command decorations are now shown in the scroll bar, similar to the editor.
- Command decorations should be restored across window reloads (or detach/attach).
- Better tracking of commands when resizing the terminal on Windows.
- Improved handling of the `Terminal: Clear` VS Code command and `clear` shell command.
- zsh right prompt support.
- Handle more formats of bash's `$PROMPT_COMMAND` variable.
- Support pwsh when PSReadLine is not enabled.
- Shell initialization scripts can now opt-out of shell integration by unsetting the `$VSCODE_SHELL_INTEGRATION` variable if there are known issues or they need special handling, even when the setting is enabled.

## Extension authoring

### Notebook aware document selectors

We have finalized an extension of the `vscode.DocumentSelector` type. This type allows you to associate language features like **Go to Definition** to specific documents, it drives the UI, and also decides if the corresponding provider is asked for results. We have added a new property that allows extensions to narrow down on notebook types. For example, `{ language: 'python', notebookType: 'jupyter-notebook'}` targets all python documents that are embedded in Jupyter notebooks.

### Inlay hints can have edits

The `InlayHint` type can now have an optional, lazy [textEdits](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a4aa4127986fb44c52732ef85e6224093e2d8b0a/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L4700-L4710) property. Inlay hints that have edits set to them will apply them on double-click. This should be used to make the edits that are needed to make the inlay hints obsolete. For example, double clicking a hint representing an inferred type should insert that type annotation.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Notebook document change events

There is a new proposal for notebook document change events: it is available as [`notebookDocumentEvents`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/9d2324412916035d7a955150ac1774d5b25e265a/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.notebookDocumentEvents.d.ts) and contains two events:

* `vscode.workspace.onDidSaveNotebookDocument` fires whenever a notebook has been saved
* `vscode.workspace.onDidChangeNotebookDocument` fires whenever a notebook has changed, e.g cells were added or removed, cells themselves changed, or metadata changed.

### Tabs API shape finalization

The [tabs API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e0df95f34b340211e6d6375c603d16e61b34129b/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.tabs.d.ts) is approaching finalization next milestone and is currently in a state where the shape will remain stable with little to no changes done. The April 2022 iteration will be the last chance to provide feedback regarding the shape and features of this API. Feedback can be provided via GitHub issue. The tabs API allows for the reading of open tabs, their locations, alongside closing of them.

## Engineering

### RPM package requirements list improvement

We now manually calculate the dependencies needed for the rpm packages based on the shared libraries and binaries that come with the product.

## Notable fixes

* [142754](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/142754) Emacs usage in VSCode terminal is broken
