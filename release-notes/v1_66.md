# March 2022 (version 1.66)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.66 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[March iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/144519)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22March+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Local History

Local history of files is now available from the **Timeline** view. Depending on the configured settings, every time you save an editor, a new entry is added to the list:

![Local History](images/1_66/local-history.gif)

Each local history entry contains the full contents of the file at the time the entry was created and in certain cases can provide more semantic information (for example indicate refactorings).

From an entry you can:
* compare the changes to the local file or previous entry
* restore the contents
* delete or rename the entry

New global commands have been added to work with local history:
* `workbench.action.localHistory.create`: create a new history entry for the active file with a custom name
* `workbench.action.localHistory.deleteAll`: delete all history entries across all files
* `workbench.action.localHistory.restoreViaPicker`: find a history entry to restore across all files

A bunch of new settings have been introduced to work with local history:
* `workbench.localHistory.enabled`: enable or disable local history (default: `true`)
* `workbench.localHistory.maxFileSize`: a limit of file size to create a local history entry (default: `256kb`)
* `workbench.localHistory.maxFileEntries`: a limit of local history entries per file (default: `50`)
* `workbench.localHistory.exclude`: glob patterns for excluding certain files from local history
* `workbench.localHistory.mergeWindow`: interval in seconds during which the last entry in local file history is replaced with the entry that is being added (default `10s`)

The new filter action from the timeline toolbar allows you to enable or disable individual providers:

![Timeline Filter](images/1_66/timeline-filter.png)

**Note:** local history entries are stored in different locations depending on your use of VS Code. When opening local files, the entries are persisted in the local user data folder and when opening remote files they will be stored on the remote user data folder. When no file system is available (for example in certain cases when using VS Code for Web), entries are stored into IndexedDB.

### Primary notification buttons

The first button of a notification now appears with a primary color to distinguish from other buttons. This follows the same patterns as dialogs.

### New context keys for editors

New context keys were added to figure out if an editor is first or last in an editor group:

* `activeEditorIsFirstInGroup`- Whether the active editor is the first one in its group.
* `activeEditorIsLastInGroup`- Whether the active editor is the last one in its group.

### Settings editor

#### Language filter

Users can now type `@lang:languageId` in the Settings editor search widget to view and edit all settings that can be configured
for the language with ID `languageId`. This way, users can view language-specific settings, also known as language overrides.

Note that these overrides remain configured until explicitly reset by clicking in the gear icon and resetting the setting.

#### Workspace and Folder settings preservation

Workspace and folder settings in the Settings editor are now preserved until manually reset by the user.
This change helps with cases where the user wants to explicitly specify a workspace setting value that is equal to the default value of a setting,
but is different from the user-scope setting value. Previously, users had to open the workspace settings JSON file for that case.

## Editor

### Quick suggestions as inline completions

The `editor.quickSuggestions` setting now accepts `inline` as configuration value. When set quick suggestions, aka IntelliSense as you type, don't pop up the suggest widget but completions show as ghosted text.

### Snippet variables for cursor index

There is new snippet variables: `$CURSOR_INDEX` and `$CURSOR_NUMBER`. They evaluate to the index of the respective cursor. The latter starts at 1, the former at 0. The power of these variables is in its combination with multiple cursors, e.g the snippet below will add an ordered list item for each cursor

```json
"ordered_list": {
  "scope": "markdown",
  "prefix": "ol",
  "body": [
    "$CURSOR_NUMBER. $0"
  ],
  "description": "Add ordered list"
}
```


## VS Code for the Web

### Drag and drop folders into VS Code for the Web

You can now drag and drop local files and folders into a browser window opened on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) or [insiders.vscode.dev](https://insiders.vscode.dev) with a browser that supports the [web file system access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) to access the contents. This works both when dropping over the editor area as well as the explorer.

## Extension authoring


### Notebook aware document selectors

We have finalised an extension of the `vscode.DocumentSelector`-type. This type allows you to associate language features like **Go to Definition** to specific documents, it drives the UI and also decides if the corresponding provider is asked for results. We have added a new property that allows extensions to narrow down on notebook types. For example, `{ language: 'python', notebookType: 'jupyter-notebook'}` targets all python documents that are embedded in Jupyter notebooks.

### Inlay hints can have edits

The `InlayHint`-type can now have an optional, lazy [`textEdits`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a4aa4127986fb44c52732ef85e6224093e2d8b0a/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L4700-L4710)-property. Inlay hints that have edits set to them will apply them on double click. This should be used to make the edits that are needed to make the inlay hints obsolete, e.g double clicking an hint representing an infered type should insert that type annotation.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Notebook document change events

There is a new proposal for notebook document change events: it is available as [`notebookDocumentEvents`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/9d2324412916035d7a955150ac1774d5b25e265a/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.notebookDocumentEvents.d.ts) and contains two events:

* `vscode.workspace.onDidSaveNotebookDocument` fires whenever a notebook has been saved
* `vscode.workspace.onDidChangeNotebookDocument` fires whenever a notebook has changed, e.g cells were added or removed, cells themselves changed, or metadata changed.



## Engineering

### RPM package requirements list improvement

We now manually calculate the dependencies needed for the rpm packages based on the shared libraries and binaries that come with the product.

## Notable fixes

* [143513](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/143513) contributes.configuration items respects "order" attribute in views only if search box empty
* [144458](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/144458) Glob patterns `**/p*` incorrectly match on `/foo/ap`
* [144783](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/144783) Settings list widget items that are not being edited don't seem to have a max width
* [145243](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/145243) Settings toc unable to be resized in smaller screens
