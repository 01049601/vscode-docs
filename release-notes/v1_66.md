Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.66 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

## Workbench

### Local History

TODO@bpasero

### Primary notification buttons

The first button of a notification now appears with a primary color to distinguish from other buttons. This follows the same patterns as dialogs.

_Theme: [GitHub Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

### New context keys for editors

New context keys were added to figure out if an editor is first or last in an editor group:

* `activeEditorIsFirstInGroup`- Whether the active editor is the first one in its group.
* `activeEditorIsLastInGroup`- Whether the active editor is the last one in its group.

## VS Code for the Web

### Drag and drop folders into VS Code for the Web

With browsers that support the local file system access API (Chrome, Edge), you can now simply drag and drop files and folders into the window to access the contents. This works both when dropping over the editor area as well as the explorer.

## Notable fixes

* [144458](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/144458) Glob patterns `**/p*` incorrectly match on `/foo/ap`
