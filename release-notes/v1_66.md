# March 2022 (version 1.66)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.66 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[March iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/144519)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22March+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Local history

Local history of files is now available from the **Timeline** view. Depending on the configured settings, every time you save an editor, a new entry is added to the list:

![Local History](images/1_66/local-history.gif)

Each local history entry contains the full contents of the file at the time the entry was created and in certain cases can provide more semantic information (for example indicate refactorings).

From an entry you can:

* Compare the changes to the local file or previous entry.
* Restore the contents.
* Delete or rename the entry.

There are new global commands to work with local history:

* `workbench.action.localHistory.create` - Create a new history entry for the active file with a custom name.
* `workbench.action.localHistory.deleteAll` - Delete all history entries across all files.
* `workbench.action.localHistory.restoreViaPicker` - Find a history entry to restore across all files.

There are also new settings to work with local history:

* `workbench.localHistory.enabled` - Enable or disable local history (default: `true`).
* `workbench.localHistory.maxFileSize` - File size limit when creating a local history entry (default: `256 KB`).
* `workbench.localHistory.maxFileEntries` - Local history entries limit per file (default: `50`).
* `workbench.localHistory.exclude` - Glob patterns for excluding certain files from local history.
* `workbench.localHistory.mergeWindow` - Interval in seconds during which the last entry in local file history is replaced with the entry that is being added (default `10s`).

A new filter action in the Timeline view toolbar allows you to enable or disable individual providers:

![Timeline Filter](images/1_66/timeline-filter.png)

**Note:** Local history entries are stored in different locations depending on your use of VS Code. When opening local files, the entries are persisted in the local user data folder and when opening remote files, they will be stored on the remote user data folder. When no file system is available (for example, in certain cases when using VS Code for Web), entries are stored into IndexedDB.

### Settings editor

**Language filter**

Users can now type `@lang:languageId` in the Settings editor search box to view and edit all settings that can be configured
for the language with ID `languageId`. This way, users can view language-specific settings, also known as language overrides.

Note that these overrides remain configured until explicitly reset by clicking in the gear icon and resetting the setting.

The short video below has the language filter set to `@lang:css` to display all possible CSS language override settings.

![Modification of a boolean CSS language-specific setting to turn off CodeLens in the Diff editor](images/1_66/settings-editor-lang-css-settings.gif)

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme)_

**Workspace and Folder settings preservation**

Workspace and folder settings in the Settings editor are now preserved until manually reset by the user. This change helps the case where the user wants to explicitly specify a workspace setting value that is equal to the default value of a setting, but is different from the user setting value. Previously, users had to open the workspace settings JSON file to set this value.

Below the editor tab size is set in Settings editor **Workspace** tab and it is automatically added to the workspace's `settings.json` file.

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme)_

### Primary notification buttons

The first button of a notification now appears with a primary color to distinguish from other buttons. This follows the same patterns as dialogs.

![Notification first button displayed as green primary color](images/1_66/notification.png)

_Theme: [GitHub Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

### New context keys for editors

There are new context keys indicating whether an editor is the first or last in an editor group:

* `activeEditorIsFirstInGroup`- Whether the active editor is the first one in its group.
* `activeEditorIsLastInGroup`- Whether the active editor is the last one in its group.

These context keys can be used to conditionally enable keyboard shortcuts using [when clauses](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_when-clause-contexts).

### Default binary editor

A new setting, `workbench.editor.defaultBinaryEditor`, lets you circumvent the binary file warning and automatically open the editor type of your choosing when a binary file is detected. You can select the default binary editor ID from a dropdown in the Settings editor or via IntelliSense in `settings.json`.

### Smoother authentication experiences

You may notice smoother authentication flows of both GitHub and Microsoft.

* For GitHub authentication, we've removed the initial "Continue" page so your log in experience requires one less step.
* For Microsoft authentication, we try to minimize the amount of times you are sent out of VS Code to log in if you've already logged in with Microsoft for Settings Sync or another extension.

### Install Pre-release and normal extensions together from CLI

VS Code now supports installing pre-release and normal extensions together from the command line. For example, following command line instruction will install the pre-release version of `GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github` extension and release version of `GitHub.remotehub` extension:

```
code --install-extension GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github@prerelease --install-extension GitHub.remotehub
```

### Improved platform specific extension updates

VS Code now supports updating a platform specific extension to more specific target platform version. For example, if you are on Windows 64 bit and have installed **C/C++** extension for Windows 32 bit and the Marketplace has the extension with same version for Windows 64 bit, VS Code will automatically update the extension to the 64 bit version.

## Terminal

### Display all find matches

When searching in the terminal, all instances of the search term will now be highlighted. The currently selected match also has a specific highlight, which can be customized separately.

You can fine tune the appearance of highlight colors via the color customizations prefixed by `terminal.findMatch`.

![A yellow border is shown around all matches except for the currently selected one, which has a red border.](images/1_66/find-matches.png)

### Scroll bar annotations

Annotations now appear in the scrollbar of the terminal to indicate points of interest in the buffer.

For example, find results have corresponding annotations in the scrollbar.

![The terminal scroll bar displaying brown annotations for find matches within a file](images/1_66/find-scrollbar.png)

When the preview feature of [shell integration](#terminal-shell-integration) is enabled, an annotation is displayed in the scroll bar for each command that gets run.

![Commands are run and corresponding annotations appear in the scrollbar](images/1_66/command-annotations.png)

### Command navigation improvements

A little known feature that's been around for a while is the ability to quickly navigate between commands in the terminal. Originally this was based on when `Enter` was pressed but now when shell integration is enabled, it will be upgraded to use the insights we gain from that feature to more reliably identify the correct lines. Additionally, feedback is now shown when jumping between commands.

TODO: Gif

This feature can be accessed via the following keybindings:

* macOS: `Cmd+Up/Down`
* Linux/Windows: `Ctrl+Up/Down` (new)

The `Shift` key can be held to make selections.

### Copied text retains HTML styling

To copy rich text from the terminal, run the **Terminal: Copy text as HTML** command or use the terminal context menu entry **Copy text as HTML**.

## Editor

### Quick suggestions as inline completions

The `editor.quickSuggestions` setting now accepts `inline` as configuration value. When set to `inline`, quick suggestions (IntelliSense) don't display the suggestions widget when you type but show completions as ghosted text.

![Inline completions show and update as ypu type](images/1_66/inline-quick-suggest.gif)

_Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

### Snippet variables for cursor index

There are new snippet variables: `$CURSOR_INDEX` and `$CURSOR_NUMBER`. They evaluate to the index of the respective cursor. The latter starts at 1, the former at 0. The power of these variables is in its combination with multiple cursors.

For example, the snippet below will add an ordered list item for each cursor:

```json
"ordered_list": {
  "scope": "markdown",
  "prefix": "ol",
  "body": [
    "$CURSOR_NUMBER. $0"
  ],
  "description": "Add ordered list"
}
```

### Updated source control decorators

In order to make the source control decorators more visible for accessibility, we've added a new pattern for modified lines and increased the contrast for all decorators.

![Example of the modified decorator for source control](images/1_66/scm.gif)

## VS Code for the Web

### Drag and drop folders into VS Code for the Web

You can now drag and drop local files and folders into a browser window opened on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) or [insiders.vscode.dev](https://insiders.vscode.dev) with a browser that supports the [web file system access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) to access the contents. This works both when dropping over the editor area as well as the explorer.

![Drop folder into vscode.dev](images/1_66/web-dnd.gif)

## Notebooks

### Find decorations on scroll bar

The find results in notebooks will now be rendered in the scroll bar:

![Find decorations rendered in the scroll bar](images/1_66/notebook-find-scrollbar.gif)

### Move focus to the interactive window

There are two new commands for placing focus in the interactive window.

* `interactive.input.focus` - Move focus to the input editor in the interactive window.
* `interactive.history.focus` - Move focus to history in interactive window.

These commands don't have default keybindings but you can add your own [keyboard shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).

## Contributions to extensions

### Python

**Changes to the interpreter display in the Status bar**

The [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension, in order to be consistent with other languages, moved the selected Python interpreter information towards the right side in the Status bar beside the **Python** language status item. With the intention of cleaning up the Status bar, it's now only displayed when a Python or a `settings.json` file is currently open.

![Interpreters info displayed towards right](images/1_66/active-interpreter-display.png)

### Jupyter

There were several improvements to the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension this milestone.

**Kernel Support**

Kernel startup was improved with:

* Support for more [conda](https://docs.conda.io) environments.
* Support for `.env` files on all platforms.

**Data Viewer**

Named indexes for DataFrames and Series are now supported in the Data Viewer.

![Named indexes support in Jupyter Data Viewer](images/1_66/named-index.png)

**New Jupyter Notebook**

Creation of new Jupyter notebooks is now consolidated in the **New File...** menu.

![New File... menu to create a new Jupyter notebook](images/1_66/new-notebook.png)

### Remote Development

Work continues on the [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), which allow you to use a container, remote machine, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Feature highlights in 1.66 include:

* "Open in Remote Container" badge - Direct users of your repo to reopen in a custom development container.
* The Remote - SSH extension can now connect to remote Apple Silicon/M1/ARM64 machines.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_66.md).

## Preview features

### Terminal shell integration

Shell integration continued to see more improvements this release mainly in for form of reliability and improvements to the decorations which can be seen in the Terminal section above.

Here are the highlights:

* Command decorations are now shown in the scroll bar, similar to the editor.
* Command decorations should be restored across window reloads (or detach/attach).
* Better tracking of commands when resizing the terminal on Windows.
* Improved handling of the **Terminal: Clear** VS Code command and `clear` shell command.
* zsh right prompt support.
* Handle more formats of bash's `$PROMPT_COMMAND` variable.
* Support `pwsh` when PSReadLine is not enabled.
* Shell initialization scripts can now opt-out of shell integration by unsetting the `$VSCODE_SHELL_INTEGRATION` variable if there are known issues or they need special handling, even when the setting is enabled.

## Extension authoring

### Notebook aware document selectors

We have finalized an extension of the `vscode.DocumentSelector` type. This type allows you to associate language features like **Go to Definition** to specific documents, it drives the UI, and also decides if the corresponding provider is asked for results. We have added a new property that allows extensions to narrow down on notebook types. For example, `{ language: 'python', notebookType: 'jupyter-notebook'}` targets all python documents that are embedded in Jupyter notebooks.

### Inlay hints can have edits

The `InlayHint` type can now have an optional, lazy [textEdits](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a4aa4127986fb44c52732ef85e6224093e2d8b0a/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L4700-L4710) property. Inlay hints that have edits set to them will apply them on double-click. This should be used to make the edits that are needed to make the inlay hints obsolete. For example, double clicking a hint representing an inferred type should insert that type annotation.

### Output channel with custom language ID

In this milestone, we have finalized the [API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/dc2f5d8dd1790ac4fc6054e11b44e36884caa4be/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L9415) to create an output channel with custom language ID. This will allow you to contribute token or syntax coloring and CodeLens features to your Output Channel by passing a languge ID.

## Debugger extension authoring

### Support for CompletionItem.detail

Last month, the Debug Adapter Protocol added a `detail` property to the `CompletionItem` object. This property is now supported in VS Code. You will see the detail in the suggest widget in the Debug Console.

![debug detail field](images/1_66/debug-detail.png)

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### InputBox validation message severity

Our InputBox APIs (via `window.showInputBox` and `window.createInputBox`) provide mechanisms for validating the user's input. This iteration we are extending it with a proposed API to show severity.

For example, if you wanted to show the user an information message based on their input, your validation message can return:

```ts
{ content: 'this is an info message'; severity: InputBoxValidationSeverity.Info }
```

which would look like this:

![Input box severity](images/1_66/inputboxseverity.png)

Details of this proposal [can be found here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/68802ccc44e21661aa426bfd211c6e94788aa42b/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.inputBoxSeverity.d.ts).

### Notebook document change events

There is a new proposal for notebook document change events: it is available as [`notebookDocumentEvents`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/9d2324412916035d7a955150ac1774d5b25e265a/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.notebookDocumentEvents.d.ts) and contains two events:

* `vscode.workspace.onDidSaveNotebookDocument` fires whenever a notebook has been saved
* `vscode.workspace.onDidChangeNotebookDocument` fires whenever a notebook has changed, e.g cells were added or removed, cells themselves changed, or metadata changed.

### Tabs API shape finalization

The [tabs API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e0df95f34b340211e6d6375c603d16e61b34129b/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.tabs.d.ts) is approaching finalization next milestone and is currently in a state where the shape will remain stable with little to no changes done. The April 2022 iteration will be the last chance to provide feedback regarding the shape and features of this API. Feedback can be provided via GitHub issue. The tabs API allows for the reading of open tabs, their locations, alongside closing of them.

## Engineering

### RPM package requirements list improvement

We now manually calculate the dependencies needed for the rpm packages based on the shared libraries and binaries that come with the product.

## Notable fixes

* [142754](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/142754) Emacs usage in VSCode terminal is broken
* [143513](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/143513) contributes.configuration items respects "order" attribute in views only if search box empty
* [144458](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/144458) Glob patterns `**/p*` incorrectly match on `/foo/ap`
* [144783](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/144783) Settings list widget items that are not being edited don't seem to have a max width
* [145243](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/145243) Settings toc unable to be resized in smaller screens

## New documentation

### R in VS Code

There is a new [R in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r) topic describing [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org) support in VS Code with the [R extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ikuyadeu.r). The R extension includes rich language features such as code completions and linting as well as integrated R terminals and dedicated workspace, data, and plot viewers.

![R extension](images/1_66/r-extension.png)

### Development containers blog post

In case you missed Burke Holland's recent blog post on using dev containers to create easy to use programming environments, check out ["The problem with tutorials"](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/03/08/the-tutorial-problem). The blog post describes how [Laravel](https://laravel.com) uses pre-configured Docker containers to provide the runtime and dependencies for their PHP framework tutorials.

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
