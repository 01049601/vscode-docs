# September 2022 (version 1.72)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.72 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22September+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Extension Authoring

### Extension debugging in a clean environment

When debugging an extension, there was always the problem that the extension was running in the development environment (user settings and installed extensions) of the author of the extension and not in an environment that was more appropriate for the target user of the extension.

With the recently introduced "profiles" feature it is now possible to run the extension under development in a different environment by specifying a profile in the extension's debug configuration.

Two scenarios are supported:
- "debugging in a clean environment" by using an unnamed "empty" profile that gets automatically deleted when extension debugging has stopped.
- "debugging in a controlled environment" by using a named profile that has been created specifically for the extension under development, and that contains specific user settings and extensions.

This debug configuration shows how to "debug in a clean environment":
```json
{
    "name": "Extension",
    "type": "extensionHost",
    "request": "launch",
    "args": [
        "--profile-temp",
        "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"
    ],
    "outFiles": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"
    ],
    "preLaunchTask": "npm: watch"
}
```

And here is a debug configuration for "debugging in a controlled environment" that uses a previously created profile named "extensionContext":
```json
{
    "name": "Extension",
    "type": "extensionHost",
    "request": "launch",
    "args": [
        "--profile=extensionContext",
        "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"
    ],
    "outFiles": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"
    ],
    "preLaunchTask": "npm: watch"
}
```

Please note:
when debugging an extension in a remote location (via the "Remote Development" extensions "Containers", "SSL", or "WSL"), using the `--profile-temp` flag will result in this status message:

![2022-09-08_11-46-47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1898161/189095058-404ac789-43c1-4660-8749-f524b5953443.png)

This is expected because the temporary profile does not include any extensions, which means that the "Remote Development" extensions are missing too. For remote scenarios it is recommended to create an empty named profile, add the "Remote Development" extensions to it, and then use the `--profile=....` command line option.

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### New 'startDebugging' reverse request

Today VS Code supports multiple concurrent debug sessions but the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol) (DAP) covers only a single session. That means that creating new debug sessions programmatically is not part of DAP and can only be done outside of DAP or the debug adapter, typically in the debug extension that contains the debug adapter. As a consequence multi-session functionality, such as automatically debugging child-processes, is not easily available for non-VS Code DAP clients, because they typically use only the debug adapter and not the VS Code specific debug extension.

To improve this situation, we have added a new reverse request `startDebugging` to DAP that allows to create a new debug session (of the same type as the caller) from **within** the debug adapter. A client capability `supportsStartDebuggingRequest` indicates to a debug adapter that the client supports `startDebugging`.

Please note that in the September release, VS Code did not implement `startDebugging`, nor does the built-in `js-debug` use `startDebugging`.
