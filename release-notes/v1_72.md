# September 2022 (version 1.72)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.72 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22September+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Ability to disable incremental naming, in file explorer

A new value of `disabled` has been introduced to the `explorer.incrementalNaming` setting. This allows for completely disabling any logic surrounding changing the file name on paste within the explorer. If the file name is already present you will be prompted to overwrite the existing file, similar to most native explorers.

### Built-in preview for some audio and video files

<!-- TODO: mbjvz -->

## Editor

### New Code Action groups

There are two new groups available in the [Code Action control](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_71#_new-code-action-control), `Inline` and `Move`.

These groups correspond to that `refactor.inline` and `refactor.move` Code Action kinds.

### New Code Action colors

You may notice that the [Code Action control](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_71#_new-code-action-control) also looks a little different this iteration. That's because we've tweaked its styling to use better [theme colors](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color). The biggest change is that the control body now uses `editorWidget.*` colors instead of `menu.*`.

We are still refining these colors, so please let us know if they don't work well with a given theme or if any color customization options are missing.

## Source Control

## Terminal


### Terminal quick fixes

We're starting to roll out a new feature powered by shell integration called quick fixes.

A quick fix is avaialable when a command maps to a set of actions the user will likely take and can be activated via the same keybinding used in the editor `kbstyle(Ctrl+.)` or `kbstyle(Cmd+.)`.

Here are the initial supported quick fixes:

#### Git similar command

When a git command is mistyped, the quick fix suggests the similar command.

![Run: git status is suggested after git sttatus is typed](images/1_72/quick-fix-similar.png)

#### Git set upstream

When `git push` is executed and there's no upstream remote, the quick fix suggests to push with the upstream remote arguments.

![Git push set upstream is suggested](images/1_72/quick-fix-push.png)

#### Git create PR

When a branch is pushed for the first time to the remote, the quick fix suggests to open the link to create a PR.

![An open github PR link action is offered](images/1_72/quick-fix-create-pr.png)


#### Free port

When a server is launched using a port that is already in use, the quick fix offers an action to kill the process and free the port.

![A server launch fails with a port 3000 in use error. An action to free port 3000 is offered.](images/1_72/quick-fix-free-port.png)

### Shell integration improvements

The following improvements to shell integration were made:

- Run recent command and go to recent directory will now clear the line if it has content (or if it cannot be reliably determined).
- Removed the bash script's usage of the `$PREFIX` environment variable which could conflict with some build tools.
- Polished the zsh script to fix some edge cases around `$ZDOTDIR`.
- Better handling of zsh shell integration on machines that are shared between multiple users.


### Hyperlink support

[Hyperlinks sent from the application](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) running in the terminal are now supported. These allow presenting a label that points to a URL and appear with a dashed underline:

![Hyperlinks appear in the terminal with dashed underlines, hovering the hyperlink reveals the URL](images/1_72/terminal-hyperlink.png)

Here's an example of how you could write a link with a label "VS Code" that points to https://code.visualstudio.com/:

```
printf '\e]8;;https://code.visualstudio.com\e\\VS Code\e]8;;\e\\'
```

Or more generally:

```
\x1b]8;; <URL> \x1b\ <Label> \x1b]8;;\x1b\'
```

### VT feature support

This version brings support for these escape sequences:

- `DECRQM`: ANSI and DEC private mode reporting (`CSI Ps $ p`) - This sequence allows programs to query various modes the terminal is in, such as wraparound or bracketed paste modes.
- `DECSCA`: Protection attribute (`CSI Ps " q`) - This attribute determines whether `DECSED` and `DECSEL` can erase content.

### Audio bell

The audio bell works now in the terminal and can be enabled via `terminal.integrated.enableBell`.

## Tasks

### Task completion sound

Tasks play a sound when they finish to enable multi-tasking, improve accessibility, and more.

Configure this via `audioCues.taskEnded`.

### Pin run task entries

Tasks can be pinned in the `Tasks: Run Task` list for faster and easier access.

![Pinned items comprise the top category in the list](images/1_72/pinned-tasks.png)

## Notebooks

### Notebook JavaScript output is now evaluated as a module

JavaScript output in notebooks is now treated as a module. This means that variables declared inside the output will no longer leak into other outputs (and in the case of `const` variables, potentially even prevent other outputs with conflicting variable names from being run).

This also means you can now use `import` inside of JavaScript outputs:

```js
%%javascript
import { myFunction } from './myModules.js';

console.log(myFunction());
```

### HTML headers supported in the notebook outline

HTML headers in markdown cells can now be detected and rendered in the notebook outline view.

![html headers in notebook markdown cells](images/1_72/notebook-outline-html-headers.png)

## Languages

### Markdown link diagnostics

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Extract to link definition for Markdown

## Remote Development

The Remote Development extensions allow you to use a development container, remote machine, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

We've heard your feedback about the naming of the **Remote-WSL** and **Remote-Containers** extensions. We intended for `Remote` in their names to indicate you develop in a "remote" or "separate" WSL distro or development container, rather than traditional local development. However, this is a different use of "remote" than many people use, and it could lead to confusion (i.e. is the dev container on my machine?).

Thus, we've updated naming and in-product commands in these extensions to be clearer, renaming them to the [`WSL` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) and the [`Dev Containers` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). Links such as the extension identifier in the marketplace and documentation remain the same, so you shouldn't see breakage in your current use of these two extensions.

![WSL extension in the marketplace](images/1_72/wsl-extension.png)

![Dev Containers extension in the marketplace](images/1_72/dev-containers-extension.png)

Along with the rename, work continued on features and fixes of these extensions as well. You can learn more in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_72.md).

## Contributions to extensions
### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. Highlights of this release include:

* Improved support for GitHub Enterprise. This includes:
  - PAT-less authentication courtesy of the VS Code built in GitHub Enterprise authentication provider.
  - Automatic detection when you open a folder with an Enterprise repo and an on-ramp to get set up.
  - Fixes for GitHub Enterprise bugs.
* Checkboxes for marking files as viewed.

Check out the [changelog for the 0.52.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0520) release of the extension to see the other highlights.

### Jupyter

#### Cell tags and slideshow editing support

We can now edit cell tags and slideshow types directly in notebook editor without opening the json format of the document.

This allows us to paramaterize the notebooks for [papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill) or customize notebooks for [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert).

![edit cell tags](images/1_72/notebook-cell-tags.gif)

We can now also update notebook cells' slide show type directly through commands to turn the notebooks into slides for presentation.

![edit slideshow](images/1_72/notebook-slideshow.gif)

## Extension Authoring

### Extension debugging in a clean environment

When debugging an extension, there was always the problem that the extension was running in the development environment (user settings and installed extensions) of the author of the extension and not in an environment that was more appropriate for the target user of the extension.

With the recently introduced "profiles" feature it is now possible to run the extension under development in a different environment by specifying a profile in the extension's debug configuration.

Two scenarios are supported:

* **debugging in a clean environment** by using an unnamed "empty" profile that gets automatically deleted when extension debugging has stopped.
* **debugging in a controlled environment** by using a named profile that has been created specifically for the extension under development, and that contains specific user settings and extensions.

This debug configuration shows how to debug in a clean environment:

```json
{
    "name": "Extension",
    "type": "extensionHost",
    "request": "launch",
    "args": [
        "--profile-temp",
        "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"
    ],
    "outFiles": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"
    ],
    "preLaunchTask": "npm: watch"
}
```

And here is a debug configuration for debugging in a controlled environment that uses a previously created profile named "extensionContext":

```json
{
    "name": "Extension",
    "type": "extensionHost",
    "request": "launch",
    "args": [
        "--profile=extensionContext",
        "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"
    ],
    "outFiles": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"
    ],
    "preLaunchTask": "npm: watch"
}
```

Note that when debugging an extension in a remote location (via the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extensions Dev Containers, SSL, or WSL), using the `--profile-temp` flag will result in this status message:

![Disconnected status bar message](images/1_72/remote-status-message.png)

This is expected because the temporary profile does not include any extensions, which means that the Remote Development extensions are missing too. For remote scenarios, it is recommended that you create an empty named profile, add the Remote Development extensions to it, and then use the `--profile=....` command line option.

### Editing notebooks with WorkspaceEdit

Workspace edits can now modify notebooks with `vscode.NotebookEdit`. The `vscode.NotebookEdit` class includes static factory functions for creating edits the insert, replace, and delete cells in a notebook:

```ts
const currentNotebook = vscode.window.activeNotebookEditor?.notebook;
if (currentNotebook) {
  const edit = new vscode.WorkspaceEdit();

  // Use .set to add one or more edits to the notebook
  edit.set(currentNotebook.uri, [
    // Create an edit that inserts one or more cells after the first cell in the notebook
    vscode.NotebookEdit.insertCells(/* index */ 1, [
      // ... new notebook cell data
    ]),

    // Additional notebook edits...
  ]);

  await vscode.workspace.applyEdit(edit);
}
```

### Contributed webview context menus

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### New theme variable for active theme in webviews

The new `data-vscode-theme-id` data attribute in webviews stores the id of the currently active theme. This replaces the now deprecated `data-vscode-theme-name` attribute, which tracked the theme's full name (and which also may have been localized):

```css
body[data-vscode-theme-id="One Dark Pro"] {
    background: hotpink;
}
```

If you were using `data-vscode-theme-name` in your webview, migrate to the new `data-vscode-theme-id` attributed.

### Async notebook renderers

The [notebook renderer API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook#notebook-renderer) now better support asynchronous notebook renderers. While this was implicitly supported previously, now `renderOutputItem` can return a `Promise` to indicate that the output item is being rendered. The `renderOutputItem` function is now also passed an [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) that is aborted if rendered is canceled

```ts
renderOutputItem(outputItem: OutputItem, element: HTMLElement, signal: AbortSignal): void | Promise<void>;
```

If your renderer performs any asynchronous work, please adopt these API updates so VS Code can better support your renderer.

### Refactor.move code action kind

The new `refactor.move` code action kind can be used for refactorings that move code around (such as moving a symbol to a new file or reordering code within a file).

While extensions could previously create code actions of the kind `refactor.move`, this kind is now officially documented and is [supported by the new Code Action control](#new-code-action-groups).

### Selected tree items passed to view/title actions

Commands contributed to `view/title` menus will receive 2 arguments: the first is the focused tree node and the second is all the selected items in the tree.

### `initialSize` tree view contribution finalized

Extensions that contribute views in `package.json` can use the `initialSize` property to set the initial size of the their views. `initialSize` works similarly to the css `flex-grow`. There are some restrictions on when `initialSize` is applied:

- It's only an _initial_ size. Once a view has been rendered the `initialSize` will not be applied again.
- It's only applied with the extension owns both the view and the view container.

### Tree `viewBadge` finalized

`TreeView` has an optional `viewBadge` property which can be used to set a number badge on the view's view container.

![View Badge on a view](images/1_72/view-badge.png)

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Extensible JavaScript notebook renderer

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Event for env.shell changes

The new event `env.onDidChangeShell` has been added to compliment `env.shell`:

```ts
env.onDidChangeShell(newShell => {
    console.log(newShell); // Same value as env.shell
});
```

### Tree item checkboxes

The proposed `checkboxState` lets you add checkboxes to tree items.

![Tree items with checkboxes](images/1_72/tree-item-checkbox-state.png)

```ts
this.checkboxState = { state: vscode.TreeItemCheckboxState.Unchecked, tooltip: 'mark file as viewed' };
```

### Localization as part of the API

This iteration we are introducing a new API that is designed to be used by extensions to localize strings. This replaces the previous `vscode-nls` & `vscode-nls-dev` modules that were used for localization in the past. Those will continue to work but will not receive any more features. The new API & tooling around it is designed to be familiar but also easier to use and more flexible. Additionally, including it as part of the API enables us to provide support for localizing your extensions for both VS Code for the desktop and VS Code for the web.

Localization for VS Code extensions has 4 important parts:

#### The new `vscode.10n` API

```ts
declare module 'vscode' {
	export namespace l10n {
		/**
		 * A string that can be pulled out of a localization bundle if it exists.
		 */
		export function t(message: string, ...args: any[]): string;
		/**
		 * A string that can be pulled out of a localization bundle if it exists.
		 */
		export function t(options: { message: string; args?: any[]; comment: string[] }): string;
		/**
		 * The bundle of localized strings that have been loaded for the extension.
		 */
		export const bundle: { [key: string]: string };
		/**
		 * The URI of the localization bundle that has been loaded for the extension.
		 */
		export const uri: Uri | undefined;
	}
}
```

The [`vscode.10n`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/158213#issuecomment-1241329160) Proposed API is a new namespace that is available. It provides a single function `t` that can be used to declare that a string should be localized. The function can be called with a string or an object with a `message` property. The function will return the localized string if it exists, otherwise it will return the original string. The function also supports arguments that can be used to format the string and comments that can be used to provide context for translators.

A simple example of using the new API:

```ts
import { l10n } from 'vscode';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  const message = l10n.t('Hello in {0}!', vscode.env.language);
  vscode.window.showInformationMessage(message);
}
```

In this example, the string `Hello in {0}!` will be localized if a localization bundle exists for the current language. The `{0}` will be replaced with the current language (`en` by default, or `fr` for French, `pt-br` for Brazilian Portuguese, etc). If no localization bundle exists, the string will be returned as-is and formatted with the arguments. You may be wondering where these localization bundles come from. I'll cover that in the next section.

The `vscode.10n` API also provides access to the bundle of localized strings or the URI to the bundle of strings. This is intended to be used in subprocess scenarios which I will cover later.

> IMPORTANT
>
> When you use this API, you also need to explicitly declare where the localization bundles are located. This is done by adding a `l10n` property in your package.json like so:

```json
{
  "main": "./out/extension.js",
  "l10n": "./l10n"
}
```

The `l10n` property should be a relative path to the folder that contains the localization bundles.

#### The [`@vscode/l10n-dev`](https://npmjs.com/package/@vscode/l10n-dev) module

The [`@vscode/l10n-dev`](https://npmjs.com/package/@vscode/l10n-dev) module is a new module that is used to generate the localization bundles. You can either use it as a command line tool or as a library. Both are used to generate the localization bundles by scanning for `vscode.l10n.t(..)` calls from the source code provided.

Here's a simple example of using the command line tool:

```sh
npx @vscode/l10n-dev ./src --out ./l10n
```
This will place a `bundle.l10n.json` file in the `./l10n` folder. From there you can make a `bundle.l10n.LOCALE.json` file for each locale you want to support. For example, let's say that generates the following `bundle.l10n.json` file:

```json
{
  "Hello": "Hello",
  "Hello {0}": "Hello {0}",
  "Hello {0}/This is a comment": {
    "message": "Hello {0}",
    "comment": ["This is a comment"]
  }
}
```
If you wanted to support French, you would make this:

```json
{
  "Hello": "Bonjour",
  "Hello {0}": "Bonjour {0}",
  "Hello {0}/This is a comment": "Bonjour {0}"
}
```

> NOTE: You don't need the comments in the localized bundles since the comments are only useful for translators translating the original bundle.

The `@vscode/l10n-dev` module can also be used to generate XLF files. The VS Code team generates XLF files that we then give to translators at Microsoft. The translators then give us back the translated XLF files. We then use the `@vscode/l10n-dev` module to generate the localized bundles from the translated XLF files. At some point, we plan on writing a blog post that goes into more detail about our localization process as a whole.

#### The [`@vscode/l10n`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vscode/l10n) module

Since the `vscode.l10n` API is only available in the extension host, it cannot be used in subprocesses. For this reason, we have created a new module that can be used in subprocesses to load the localization bundles. The module is called [`@vscode/l10n`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vscode/l10n) and it can be used like so:

```ts
import { l10n } from '@vscode/l10n';

// Load the translations for the current locale
l10n.config({
    uri: process.env.BUNDLE_URI_FROM_EXTENSION
});

// returns the translated string or the original string if no translation is available
l10n.t('Hello World');
```

The idea is that your extension-side code who is responsible for spinning up the subprocesses will use the `vscode.l10n.contents` or `vscode.l10n.uri` APIs to pass the bundle or the URI of the bundle to the subprocesses. The subprocesses can then use the `@vscode/l10n` module to load the bundle and use the `t` function to translate strings. The `t` function used by the `@vscode/l10n` module will also be picked up in the `@vscode/l10n-dev` module so that the strings can be extracted and localized using one process.

#### The `package.nls.json` file

Nothing has changed with respect to the `package.nls.json` file. It is still used to declare the default strings that should be localized and should be next to the `package.json`. You still can have `package.nls.LOCALE.json` (where LOCALE is something like `de` or `zh-cn`) and the strings declared in that file will be picked up first if the user has set VS Code to that locale. A small example:

Your `package.json`:
```jsonc
{
  "name": "my-extension",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "main": "./out/extension.js",
  "l10n": "./l10n",
  //...
  "contributes": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "command": "my-extension.helloWorld",
        // The key is surrounded by % characters
        "title": "%my-extension.helloWorld.title%"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Your `package.nls.json`:
```json
{
  // That same key from the package.json
  "my-extension.helloWorld.title": "Hello World"
}
```
Your `package.nls.de.json`:
```json
{
  // That same key from the package.json
  "my-extension.helloWorld.title": "Hallo Welt"
}
```

#### Summary

There's certainly a lot here to digest, but hopefully this gives you an idea of the direction we're trying to take with localization in VS Code extensions.

If you're interested in a full example, we have a sample that you can check out [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/tyler/add-l10n-extension-sample/l10n-sample).

If you have questions or feedback, please let us know in the following places:

* The [API proposal of `vscode.l10n`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/158213#issuecomment-1241329160)
* The [`vscode-l10n`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-l10n) repo (home of the `@vscode/l10n-dev` and `@vscode/l10n` modules)

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### New 'startDebugging' reverse request

Today VS Code supports multiple concurrent debug sessions but the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol) (DAP) covers only a single session. That means that creating new debug sessions programmatically is not part of DAP and can only be done outside of DAP or the debug adapter, typically in the debug extension that contains the debug adapter. As a consequence multi-session functionality, such as automatically debugging child-processes, is not easily available for non-VS Code DAP clients, because they typically use only the debug adapter and not the VS Code specific debug extension.

To improve this situation, we have added a new reverse request `startDebugging` to DAP that allows to create a new debug session (of the same type as the caller) from **within** the debug adapter. A client capability `supportsStartDebuggingRequest` indicates to a debug adapter that the client supports `startDebugging`.

Please note that in the September release, VS Code does not implement `startDebugging`, nor does the built-in `js-debug` use `startDebugging`.

## Engineering

### Improved startup performance

We reserved engineering time this milestone to improve the startup time it takes from launching VS Code to seeing a blinking cursor in the text editor. We always keep track of our performance numbers and noticed a slight degradation at the end of last milestone that we wanted to address during this milestone.

This was a team effort where everyone was contributing to with various changes throughout the code. A couple of highlights are mentioned here.

#### No more sync fs calls

We typically avoid the synchronous variants of the Node.js `fs` API knowing that these methods will stop script execution until the file system request has been resolved. However in a few cases we were still relying on sync `fs` execution, especially around opening or restoring windows on startup. We were able to change all these calls to their async variants allowing other script to continue running while waiting for the file system request to return.

#### More bundling of main entry points

Our main bundles that make VS Code app are several megabytes in size, bundled as single file using [vscode-loader](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-loader) and minified using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). However in some cases we did not invest in bundling, specifically for:

* Our Node.js entry point in the Electron main process that is always getting called first.
* Our bootstrap JavaScript files in the Electron renderer process for opening windows.

Bundling in these two areas allows us to reduce the cost of looking up JavaScript files on startup to just one call for the Electron main process and one call for the window itself.

#### Pushing code to a later phase

The best performance fix is to remove code and never run it, but that is obviously not a solution that is sustainable. An alternative is to simply delay the execution of code to a later phase, for example after the text editor has opened. In this milestone we again reviewed our various components and pushed some of them to a later phase to not block the critical startup path.

### Faster PR checks

For pull requests automatic unit, integration, and smoke-testing is performed. All this happens in parallel but each step requires that our TypeScript-sources are transpiled into JavaScript-code. Originally, we used the TypeScript compiler for this. It emits JavaScript but also does type checking. The latter is time consuming and for testing not really needed. The overall time-cost, by which testing was delayed, was around 5 minutes. We then switched to a custome transpile-only solution that uses the TypeScript compiler-api. This was much faster but still took around 2 minutes.

In this milestone we switched to [SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)](https://swc.rs) which is even faster. It now takes around 12 seconds to transpile all our TypeScript sources. This is a huge improvement and allows us to get feedback on pull requests much faster.

## Notable fixes
