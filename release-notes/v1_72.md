# September 2022 (version 1.72)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.72 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22September+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Extension Authoring

### Extension debugging in a clean environment

When debugging an extension, there was always the problem that the extension was running in the development environment (user settings and installed extensions) of the author of the extension and not in an environment that was more appropriate for the target user of the extension.

With the recently introduced "profiles" feature it is now possible to run the extension under development in a different environment by specifying a profile in the extension's debug configuration.

Two scenarios are supported:
- "debugging in a clean environment" by using an unnamed "empty" profile that gets automatically deleted when extension debugging has stopped.
- "debugging in a controlled environment" by using a named profile that has been created specifically for the extension under development, and that contains specific user settings and extensions.

This debug configuration shows how to "debug in a clean environment":
```json
{
    "name": "Extension",
    "type": "extensionHost",
    "request": "launch",
    "args": [
        "--profile-temp",
        "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"
    ],
    "outFiles": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"
    ],
    "preLaunchTask": "npm: watch"
}
```

And here is a debug configuration for "debugging in a controlled environment" that uses a previously created profile named "extensionContext":
```json
{
    "name": "Extension",
    "type": "extensionHost",
    "request": "launch",
    "args": [
        "--profile=extensionContext",
        "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"
    ],
    "outFiles": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"
    ],
    "preLaunchTask": "npm: watch"
}
```

Please note:
when debugging an extension in a remote location (via the "Remote Development" extensions "Containers", "SSL", or "WSL"), using the `--profile-temp` flag will result in this status message:

![2022-09-08_11-46-47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1898161/189095058-404ac789-43c1-4660-8749-f524b5953443.png)

This is expected because the temporary profile does not include any extensions, which means that the "Remote Development" extensions are missing too. For remote scenarios it is recommended to create an empty named profile, add the "Remote Development" extensions to it, and then use the `--profile=....` command line option.

### Contributed webview context menus

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### New theme variable for active theme in webviews

The new `data-vscode-theme-id` data attribute in webviews stores the id of the currently active theme. This replaces the now deprecated `data-vscode-theme-name` attribute, which tracked the theme's full name (and which also may have been localized):

```css
body[data-vscode-theme-id="One Dark Pro"] {
    background: hotpink;
}
```

If you were using `data-vscode-theme-name` in your webview, please migrate to the new `data-vscode-theme-id` attributed.

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### New 'startDebugging' reverse request

Today VS Code supports multiple concurrent debug sessions but the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol) (DAP) covers only a single session. That means that creating new debug sessions programmatically is not part of DAP and can only be done outside of DAP or the debug adapter, typically in the debug extension that contains the debug adapter. As a consequence multi-session functionality, such as automatically debugging child-processes, is not easily available for non-VS Code DAP clients, because they typically use only the debug adapter and not the VS Code specific debug extension.

To improve this situation, we have added a new reverse request `startDebugging` to DAP that allows to create a new debug session (of the same type as the caller) from **within** the debug adapter. A client capability `supportsStartDebuggingRequest` indicates to a debug adapter that the client supports `startDebugging`.

Please note that in the September release, VS Code does not implement `startDebugging`, nor does the built-in `js-debug` use `startDebugging`.

## Engineering

### Improved startup performance

We reserved engineering time this milestone to improve the startup time it takes from launching VS Code to seeing a blinking cursor in the text editor. We always keep track of our performance numbers and noticed a slight degradation at the end of last milestone that we wanted to address during this milestone.

This was a team efford where everyone was contributing to with various changes throughout the code. A couple of highlights are mentioned here.

#### No more sync `fs` calls

We typically avoid the synchronous variants of the node.js `fs` API knowing that these methods will stop script execution until the file system request has been resolved. However in a few cases we were still relying on sync `fs` execution, especially around opening or restoring windows on startup. We were able to change all these calls to their async variants allowing other script to continue running while waiting for the file system request to return.

#### More bundling of main entry points

Our main bundles that make VS Code app are several megabytes in size, bundled as single file using [`vscode-loader`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-loader) and minified using [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/). However in some cases we did not invest in bundling, specifically for:
* our node.js entry point in the Electron main process that is always getting called first
* our bootstrap JavaScript files in the Electron renderer process for opening windows

Bundling in these two areas allows us to reduce the cost of looking up JavaScript files on startup to just one call for the Electron main process and one call for the window itself.

#### Pushing code to a later phase

The best performance fix is to remove code and never run it, but that is obviously not a solution that is sustainable. An alternative is to simply delay the execution of code to a later phase, for example after the text editor has opened. In this milestone we again reviewed our various components and pushed some of them to a later phase to not block the critical startup path.
