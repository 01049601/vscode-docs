# Accessibility

## Settings editor

Back in July, [we mentioned](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_48#_settings-editor-improvements) that we were investigating ways to improve the accessibility of the settings editor. After a few months of talking to screen reader users, experimenting, prototyping, and gathering feedback from the community, we are shipping the new experience which we believe is an improvement for all keyboard-heavy users, whether using a screen reader or not.

In this new interaction model, interacting with the settings list works more like interacting with any other list in VS Code. With focus in the search bar, you can press the down arrow to focus a setting row. Then you can use the arrow keys to move focus around the settings list. To edit a setting, you can press enter to set focus on the control in the setting row.

Here's a demonstration of what was just described:

![settings editor as list](images/1_50/settings-editor.gif)

If you would like to read more about the motivation and thinking behind this approach, please see GitHub [issue #108006](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/108006).

## macOS: Keychain access moved to a different process

Some changes in this release around how the macOS Keychain is accessed from VS Code will require you to acknowledge the following prompt for keychain access on macOS, even if you've previously allowed keychain access:

![Keychain Access](images/1_50/keychain.png)

Details: we used to access the macOS keychain from the window process itself, but now access it from our main process. As such, for macOS it prompts access like a new application is requesting access, because the process is a different one from before.

## Editor

### Trigger IntelliSense

For years, `Ctrl+Space` has been the predominant keybinding to trigger IntelliSense. However, on macOS and Windows, the same keybinding is used to toggle between keyboard layouts. To minimize confusion, we added another keybinding to trigger IntelliSense: on Windows and Linux it's `Ctrl+I`, and on macOS it's `Cmd+I`.

## Debugging

### Debug hover improvements

- **Language hover now available while debugging**

  While debugging, the debug hover takes precedence over the language hover, making it impossible to see the language hover. Starting with this release, you can switch from the debug hover back to the language hover by holding down the `alt` modifier key. As long as `alt` is pressed, the language hover is shown instead of the debug hover. This makes it much easier to read Javadoc while debugging.

- **Auto sizing debug hover**

  In order to minimize the need for scrolling, the debug hover width and height now automatically adapts to the size of the hover contents. This not only helps you the full strings, but you can also drill down into object structures, and the hover grows as needed.

  ![Auto Sizing debug hover](images/1_50/autosize-hover.gif)

### Debug console filter improvements

The Debug Console now supports filtering, making it easier for users to find the output they are looking for, or to hide irrelevant logging output. We've added a badge to make it clear how many items are filtered away.

![Debug console badge](images/1_50/debug-console-badge.png)

### JavaScript debugging

**Consolidated auto attach flows**

Last month, we introduced [new auto attach modes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_auto-attach-feature) as an experimental feature. This month, they have left the experimental state. The previous **debug.autoAttach** setting is deprecated in favor of the **debug.javascript.autoAttachFilter** option. The auto attach badge in the status bar now shows the current mode and allows you to toggle between modes.

**Realtime performance view**

The [flame chart extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-js-profile-flame) will now show a realtime view of performance metrics while debugging JavaScript code. CPU and memory usage are shown for Node.js programs and extension debugging. Debugging Chrome or Edge will additionally show metrics for DOM nodes, relayouts, and restyles.

![Debug realtime view](images/1_50/js-debug-realtime.gif)

*Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong)*

In addition to the controls in the view, there are a few settings you can use to control it:

- **debug.flameGraph.realtimePollInterval**: how often stats are updated
- **debug.flameGraph.realtimeViewDuration**: how much time should be displayed on the graph
- **debug.flameGraph.realtimeEasing**: whether easing is enabled

**Left-heavy flame chart view**

Also new in the [flame chart extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-js-profile-flame) is a "left heavy" view, toggled by clicking the button in the upper-right corner of the chart.

This view groups call stacks and orders them by time, creating a visual representation of the "top down" table you might have used in other tools. This is especially useful if your profile has lots of thin call stacks (common with things like web servers) which are hard to get a sense of in the chronological view.

Here we have the same profile opened in the traditional chronological view on the right, and the left-heavy view on the left. With the left-heavy view it's much easier to tell exactly where time is being spent.

![Screenshot of an editor showing the two flame graphs described above](images/1_50/left-heavy-flame.png)

**Step through missing code**

Previously if you tried to debug a file which has a sourcemap, but for which the source was not available, you would get stuck on a "could not load source" error and would be unable to view the compiled code. We now show a prompt allowing you to ignore the sourcemap and step through compiled code in these cases.

![Notification that says "This is a missing file referenced by a sourcemap. Would you like to debug the compiled version instead?"](images/1_50/js-debug-compiled-code-step.png)

## Workbench

### Pinned tabs improvements

Pinned tabs were introduced in our [May 2020](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_46#_pin-tabs) release. Since then, we've received valuable feedback on how to improve this experience further, and for this milestone there are a couple of changes worth mentioning.

A new setting `workbench.editor.pinnedTabSizing` allows you to configure how large a pinned tab should appear:

- `normal`: a pinned tab inherits the look of other tabs (new default)
- `shrink`: a pinned tab shrinks to a fixed size showing parts of the editor label
- `compact`: a pinned tab will only show as icon or first letter of the editor label

If you liked how pinned tabs looked prior to this release, make sure to configure `"workbench.editor.pinnedTabSizing": "compact"`.

Pinned tabs also show a new "pinned" icon to allow you to un-pin with one click. This icon will also appear in the "Open Editors" view.

![Pinned Tabs](images/1_50/pinned_tabs.gif)
_Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)_

Some other improvements include:

- Editors can now be pinned even when tabs are disabled.
- `Cmd+W` (`Ctrl+W`) no longer closes a pinned editor, but selects the next non-pinned editor.
- A new command `workbench.action.closeActivePinnedEditor` can be assigned to close a pinned editor.
- A new `tab.lastPinnedBorder` color can be assigned to draw a border to the right of the last pinned tab.

### Renamed some editor-related context keys

A few new editor context keys have been introduced, deprecating some of the existing ones. If you are using these in your keybinding settings, please update them:

- `groupActiveEditorDirty` was renamed to `activeEditorIsDirty`
- `editorPinned` was renamed to `activeEditorIsNotPreview`
- `editorSticky` was renamed to `activeEditorIsPinned`

### SCM saves input on window reload

Addresses [this request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/41232) to save SCM input on window reload.
![a message is typed in the SCM and the window is reloaded showing the saved message](images/1_50/scm-saves.gif)

### Added panel maximization setting

A new setting, `panel.opensMaximized`, allows users to adjust whether or not the panel always opens maximized when toggled. The options are `always`, `never`, and the default value `preserve`. The `preserve` option means to open the panel maximized if it was maximized before being closed, and open it non-maximized otherwise.

### New minimum window width when panel is on the bottom

When the panel is on the bottom rather than on the side, the minimum window width is 400px instead of 600px.

### Extensions: Simplified recommendation notifications

In this release, we improved the experience of recommending extensions using notifications by making them smarter and less noisy to users.

- Recommendations notificaitons are not shown again after you tried them or went through them.
- Only one recommendation notification is shown at any time in VS Code window. You can access already recommended notifications under notification manager ie., `bell` icon in the status bar.

![Extension Recommendations Queue](images/1_50/ext-recommendations-queue.gif)

*Theme: GitHub Sharp Dark*

- Recommendation notifications supporting installations, like WSL, Docker etc., on your system, are made less nosiy by showing only one such notification once per VS Code session - A session is from the time you start and quit VS Code.

## Source Control

### Restore commit messages

The Source Control view will now remember commit messages across sessions.

### Git: Commit --no-verify commands

Git commit commands with the `--no-verify` flag are now available after enabling the `git.allowNoVerifyCommit` setting.

![git --no-verify](images/1_50/git-no-verify.png)

### Git: Multiple git.path values

You can now specify a list of locations to look for the git executable via the same `git.path` setting, by using an array of strings.

## Terminal

### Search the workspace by selecting text in the terminal

The standard shortcut for searching the workspace `kb(workbench.action.terminal.searchWorkspace)` will now use the terminal's selection if it's focused.

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Settings sync

You can now select settings sync service to use (insiders or stable) while turning on Settings Sync. **Note:** This option is available only on the [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

### TypeScript 4.1 beta support

VS Code supports the [TypeScript 4.1 beta](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1-beta/) and nightly builds. The 4.1 update brings some new TypeScript language features, such as support for [recursive conditional types](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1-beta/#recursive-conditional-types), as well as tooling improvements. One focus area has been []adding initial support](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1-beta/#jsdoc-see-tag) for `@see` tags in JSDoc comments.

To start using the TypeScript 4.1 nightly builds, just install the [TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next). Please share feedback and let us know if you run into any bugs with TypeScript 4.1.

## Extension authoring

### Submenus

The submenu API has been promoted out of proposed state. Extension authors can now define and use submenus across supported menu locations. Check out the [syntax](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/100172#issuecomment-645203070) as well as the [possibilities](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/102784#issuecomment-663036534) that this API enables.

### Source Control Resource State context value

Instances of `SourceControlResourceState` now support an optional `contextValue: string` field which allows defining a context value to match again `when` clauses in the `scm/resourceState/context` menu. The context key to use is `scmResourceState`. More details on the original [feature request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/86180) and respective [pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/90952).

### Asynchronously resolve code action

For code action providers, we have added an optional function ([`CodeActionProvider#resolveCodeAction`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/1fd7ee15d3a2c50547228b08cefc7c13a5a739d2/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L2237-L2252)) which allows you to defer the computation of the actual edits a code action is going to make. This should help reduce the time it takes to provide code actions.

### New theme colors

- `tab.lastPinnedBorder`: Border on the right of the last pinned editor to separate from unpinned editors.
- `gitDecoration.stageDeletedResourceForeground`: Foreground color for staged deletions git decorations.
- `gitDecoration.stageAddedResourceForeground`: Foreground color for staged additions git decorations.
- `charts.red`, `charts.blue`, `charts.yellow`, `charts.orange`, `charts.green`, `charts.purple`, `charts.foreground`, `charts.lines`: Colors intended to be used by data visualization extensions.

### Webview Views

The [Webview View API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/46585) allows extensions to contribute [webview](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview) based views to the sidebar or panel. These views can offer specialized presentations of data, more advanced user interfaces, and much more.

![The 'calico colors' webview view sample extension in the side bar](images/1_50/webview-view.png)

To get started with webview views, take a look at the [webview view extension sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/webview-view-sample).

## Extension contributions

### Template string converter

**[Template String Converter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meganrogge.template-string-converter)** - Converts quotes to backticks when a `$` and `{` are entered within a string in JavaScript and TypeScript files.

![typing a dollar sign then open curly brace within a string converts the quotes to backticks](images/1_50/template-string-converter-extension.gif)

### References viewlet API

The references viewlet now exports an API that allows its content to be defined by other extensions. Learn more about it here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-references-view/blob/master/src/references-view.d.ts

### Docs View

The [Docs View](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.docs-view) extension uses the new [Webview view api](#webview-views) to show documentation for the symbol at the current cursor position in the sidebar or panel:

![Showing the docs for Array.from in the panel](images/1_50/docs-view.png)

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

- You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
- You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
- Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Notebook API

The following new and changed APIs are part of the notebooks API proposal

- `NotebookCell#index` - A notebook cell belongs to a notebook document and this new property indicates at which position in the notebook document a cell sits. This property changes when a cell is moved.
- `TextDocument#notebook` - A property of a text document, which signals that it is part of a notebook, as a notebook cell document. This property is `undefined` for ordinary documents.
- Strict Editing - Notebook documents can only be modified via declarative edits that are either part of a `WorkspaceEdit` and submitted via `NotebookEditor#edit`. This ensures data consistency between extension hosts and the UI.

### Comments API

We have added a new property `readOnly` to `CommentThread` to allow hiding the reply button in a comment thread.

### ESLint

The approval flow to allow the execution of a ESLint library got reworked. The initial experience is now as follows:

- No modal dialog is shown when the ESLint extension tries to load a ESLint library for the first time and an approval is necessary. Instead, the ESLint status bar item changes to ![ESLint status icon](images/1_50/eslint-status.png) indicating that the execution is currently blocked.
- If the active text editor content can be validated using ESLint, a problem at the top of the file is shown in addition.

The execution of the ESLint library can be denied or approved using the following gestures:

- Clicking on the Status Bar icon.
- Using the quick fix for the corresponding ESLint problem.
- Executing the command `ESLint: Manage Library Execution` from the command palette.

All gestures will open the following dialog:

![ESLint Dialog](images/1_50/eslint-dialog.png)

The chosen action is then reflected in the ESLint Status Bar item in the following way:

- `Allow` will prefix the status bar item with a check mark.
- `Allow Everywhere` will prefix the status bar item with a double check mark.
- `Deny` and `Disable` will prefix the status bar item with a blocked sign.

You can manage our decisions using the following commands:

- `ESLint: Manage Library Execution` will reopen above dialog.
- `ESLint: Reset Library Decisions` lets you reset previous decisions you have made.

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### New `invalidated` event

A new `invalidated` event has been added to the protocol. This event signals that some state in the debug adapter has changed and requires that the client (frontend) needs to re-render the data previously requested.
Debug adapters do not have to emit the event for runtime changes like "stopped" or thread changes because in these cases the client refetches the new state anyway. However, the event can be used to refresh the UI after rendering formatting has changed in the debug adapter. Debug adapters should only send the event if a true `supportsInvalidatedEvent` capability was received from the client in the ‘initialize’ request. Mock debug has an [example](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/23fd6bf224234f188eff23eba83b086e1ee5917c/src/mockDebug.ts#L553) for how to use the event.

### Proposal for Conditional Exception support

We are planning to support "Conditional Exceptions" in a future version of VS Code. Since this requires support in the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) (DAP) we've prepared a [proposal for "Conditional Exception" support](https://github.com/microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/issues/137#issuecomment-698211532). If you are a debug extension author and interested in this DAP protocol addition, we'd appreciate your feedback.

## Engineering

### Linux ARM

VS Code is now available for both Linux ARMv7 and ARM64 architectures. This means you can now officially use VS Code on Raspberry Pis, Chromebooks and other ARM based devices!

![Linux ARM](images/1_50/linux-arm.png)

[Download it now](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads)! Also available for [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/#linux).

### Building VS Code with TypeScript 4.1 beta

We now use the TypeScript 4.1 nightly builds to build VS Code. TypeScript 4.1 adds a few new strictness checks, including [more strict types for `resolve` in promises](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1-beta/#resolves-parameters-are-no-longer-optional-in-promises). This improved type checking helped us to identify and fix potential bugs in our code.

## Documentation and extensions

### Updated "Create a Dev Container" tutorial

We've updated the documentation to help you [create a development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container). The tutorial now clearly walks you through the steps to create a reusable Docker container to match your development environment. You'll learn how to :

* Author a `devcontainer.json` to describe how VS Code will create and start your container.
* Add additional software and frameworks through a `Dockerfile`.
* Combine multiple Docker containers through Docker Compose.
* Build and test your custom development container.

### Microsoft C++ extension

The Microsoft C/C++ extension is now out of preview and version 1.0 has lots of great features:

* Support for Linux on ARM and ARM 64 - complete with IntelliSense and remote build and debug support.
* Code formatting - Use the same formatting settings as Visual Studio IDE, along with [EditorConfig](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/cpp-editorconfig-properties) properties.

And check out this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6PnOlmop9Y) for configuring C++ IntelliSense in VS Code.

![Microsoft C++ extension](images/1_50/cpp-extension.png)

### C++ Extension Pack

You can also install the [C/C++ Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack), which includes extensions for creating and building C++ projects as well as collaborating with Live Share, connecting to remote machine via SSH connections, and developing in the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

![C/C++ Extension Pack](images/1_50/cpp-extension-pack.png)

### Microsoft Edge Tools extension

The [Microsoft Edge Tools for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-edgedevtools.vscode-edge-devtools) extension is out of preview and provides the Microsoft Edge dev tools directly in VS Code. You will be able to see your site's runtime HTML structure, alter its layout, fix styling issues as well as see your site's network requests.

![Microsoft Edge Tools for VS Code extension](images/1_50/edge-tools-extension.png)

You can read more about this release and the extension's powerful features in this recent [blog post](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/10/01/microsoft-edge-tools-vscode/).

### Azure Cognitive Search extension

There is a new Microsoft [Azure Cognitive Search](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurecognitivesearch) extension for working with [Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search). The extension makes it easy to develop and manage your search service directly from VS Code and includes full IntelliSense and a rich set of snippets.
