# September 2020 (version 1.50)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.50 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[September iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/106677)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22September+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Editor

## Debugging

### Debug hover improvements

* **Language hover now available while debugging**

  While debugging, the debug hover takes precedence over the language hover, making it impossible to see the language hover. Starting with this release it is now possible to easily switch from the debug hover back to the language hover by holding down the `alt` modifier key. As long as `alt` is pressed the language hover is shown instead of the debug hover. This makes it much easier to read Javadoc while debugging.
* **Auto sizing debug hover**

  In order to minimize the need for scrolling, the debug hover width and height now automatically adapts to the size of the hover contents. This does not only help to see strings in full length, but you can even drill down into objects structures and the hover grows as needed.

### Debug console filter improvements

Since last milestone the Debug Console supports filtering, making it easier for users to find the output they are looking for, or to hide irrelevant logging output. Now we have added a badge to make it clear how many items are filtered away.

### JavaScript Debugging

* Consolidate auto-attach configuration flows

## Workbench

### Renamed some editor related context keys

A few new editor context keys have been introduced, deprecating some of the existing ones. If you are using these in your keybinding settings, please update them:
* `groupActiveEditorDirty` was renamed to `activeEditorIsDirty`
* `editorPinned` was renamed to `activeEditorIsNotPreview`
* `editorSticky` was renamed to `activeEditorIsPinned`

### SCM saves input on window reload

Addresses [this request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/41232) to save SCM input on window reload.

## Terminal

### Search the workspace by selecting text in the terminal

The standard shortcut for searching the workspace `kb(workbench.action.terminal.searchWorkspace)` will now use the terminal's selection if it's focused.

## Extension authoring

## Extension Contributions

**[Template String Converter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meganrogge.template-string-converter)** - Converts quotes to backticks when a `$` and `{` are entered within a string in JavaScript and TypeScript files.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### New `invalidated` event

A new `invalidated` event has been added to the protocol. This event signals that some state in the debug adapter has changed and requires that the client (frontend) needs to re-render the data previously requested.
Debug adapters do not have to emit the event for runtime changes like "stopped" or thread changes because in these cases the client re-fetches the new state anyway. But the event can be used to refresh the UI after rendering formatting has changed in the debug adapter. Debug adapters should only send the event if a true `supportsInvalidatedEvent` capability was received from the client in the ‘initialize’ request. Mock debug has an [example](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/23fd6bf224234f188eff23eba83b086e1ee5917c/src/mockDebug.ts#L553) for how to use the event.

### Proposal for Conditional Exception support

We are planning to support "Conditional Exceptions" in a future version of VS Code. Since this requires support in the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) (DAP) we've prepared a [proposal for "Conditional Exception" support](https://github.com/microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/issues/137#issuecomment-698211532). If you are a debug extension author and interested in this DAP protocol addition, we'd appreciate your feedback.
