# September 2020 (version 1.50)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.50 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[September iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/106677)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22September+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Debugging

### Debug hover improvements

#### Language hover now available while debugging
While debugging the custom debug hover takes precedence over the language hover making it impossible for users to see the language hover. It is now possible for users to switch between the debug hover and the language hover by holding down the `alt` key. As long as the `alt` key is pressed we will show the language hover and hide the debug hover. This should make it easier for users to read Javadoc whlile debugging for example.

#### Dynamic height and width

Debug hover now has a dynamic height and width, making it easier for users to drill deep down into complex objects using the debug hover. Previously the width and height were fixed making the hover rather small in most cases.

### Debug console filter improvements

Since last milestone the Debug Console supports filtering, making it easier for users to find the output they are looking for, or to hide irrelevant logging output. Now we have added a badge to make it clear how many items are filtered away.

## Extension authoring

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### New `invalidated` event

A new `invalidated` event has been added to the protocol that signals that some state in the debug adapter has changed and requires that the client needs to re-render the data previously requested.
Debug adapters do not have to emit this optional event for runtime changes like "stopped" or thread events because in that case the client (frontend) re-fetches the new state anyway. But the event can be used to refresh the UI after rendering formatting has changed in the debug adapter. Debug adapters should only send the event if a true `supportsInvalidatedEvent` capability was received from the client in the ‘initialize’ request. Mock debug has an [example](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/23fd6bf224234f188eff23eba83b086e1ee5917c/src/mockDebug.ts#L553) for how to use this event.

### Proposal for Conditional Exception support

We are planning to support "Conditional Exceptions" in a future version of VS Code. Since this requires support in the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) (DAP) we've prepared a [proposal for "Conditional Exception" support](https://github.com/microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/issues/137#issuecomment-698211532) in the DAP. If you are a debug extension author and interested in this DAP protocol addition, we'd appreciate your feedback.
