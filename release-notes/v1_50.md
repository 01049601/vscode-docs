# September 2020 (version 1.50)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.50 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[September iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/106677)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22September+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## macOS: Keychain access moved to a different process

Some changes in this release around how the macOS Keychain is accessed from VS Code will require you to acknowledge the following prompt for keychain access on macOS, even if you have already acknowledged this before:

![Keychain Access](images/1_50/keychain.png)

Details: we used to access the macOS keychain from the window process itself but now changed to access it from our main process. As such, for macOS it appears like a new application is requesting access because the process is a different one from before.

## Editor

### Trigger IntelliSense

For years `Ctrl+Space` has been the predominant keybinding to trigger IntelliSense. However, on macOS and Windows the same keybinding is used to toggle between keyboard layouts. This is confusing and we added another keybinding to trigger IntelliSense: on Windows and Linux it is `Ctrl+I`, on macOS it is `Cmd+I`.

## Debugging

### Debug hover improvements

* **Language hover now available while debugging**

  While debugging, the debug hover takes precedence over the language hover, making it impossible to see the language hover. Starting with this release it is now possible to easily switch from the debug hover back to the language hover by holding down the `alt` modifier key. As long as `alt` is pressed the language hover is shown instead of the debug hover. This makes it much easier to read Javadoc while debugging.
* **Auto sizing debug hover**

  In order to minimize the need for scrolling, the debug hover width and height now automatically adapts to the size of the hover contents. This does not only help to see strings in full length, but you can even drill down into objects structures and the hover grows as needed.

### Debug console filter improvements

Since last milestone the Debug Console supports filtering, making it easier for users to find the output they are looking for, or to hide irrelevant logging output. Now we have added a badge to make it clear how many items are filtered away.

### JavaScript Debugging

* Consolidate auto-attach configuration flows

## Workbench

### Pinned tabs improvements

Pinned tabs were introduced in our [May 2020](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_46#_pin-tabs) release. During this time we received a lot of valuable feedback how to improve this experience further and for this milestone there are a couple of changes worth mentioning.

A new setting `workbench.editor.pinnedTabSizing` allows to configure how large a pinned tab should appear:
* `normal`: a pinned tab inherits the look of other tabs (new default)
* `shrink`: a pinned tab shrinks to  a fixed size showing parts of the editor label
* `compact`: a pinned tab will only show as icon or first letter of the editor label

If you liked how pinned tabs looked prior to this release, make sure to configure `"workbench.editor.pinnedTabSizing": "compact"`.

![Pinned Tabs](images/1_50/pinned_tabs.gif)
*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)*

As you can see from the recording, pinned tabs show a new "pinned" icon to allow to un-pin with one click. This icon will also appear in the "Open Editors" view.

Some other improvements include:
* editors can now even be pinned even when tabs are disabled
* `Cmd+W` (`Ctrl+W`) no longer closes a pinned editor but selects the next non-pinned editor
* a new command `workbench.action.closeActivePinnedEditor` can be assigned to close even a pinned editor
* a new `tab.lastPinnedBorder` color can be assigned to draw a border to the right of the last pinned tab

### Renamed some editor related context keys

A few new editor context keys have been introduced, deprecating some of the existing ones. If you are using these in your keybinding settings, please update them:
* `groupActiveEditorDirty` was renamed to `activeEditorIsDirty`
* `editorPinned` was renamed to `activeEditorIsNotPreview`
* `editorSticky` was renamed to `activeEditorIsPinned`

### SCM saves input on window reload

Addresses [this request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/41232) to save SCM input on window reload.
![a message is typed in the SCM and the window is reloaded showing the saved message](images/1_50/scm-saves.gif)

### Added panel maximization setting

A new setting, `panel.opensMaximized`, allows users to adjust whether or not the panel always opens maximized when toggled. The options are `always`, `never`, and the default value `preserve`. The `preserve` option means to open the panel maximized if it was maximized before being closed, and open it non-maximized otherwise.

### New minimum window width when panel is on the bottom

When the panel is on the bottom rather than on the side, the minimum window width is 400px instead of 600px.

## Terminal

### Search the workspace by selecting text in the terminal

The standard shortcut for searching the workspace `kb(workbench.action.terminal.searchWorkspace)` will now use the terminal's selection if it's focused.

## Extension authoring

### Asynchronously Resolve Code Action

For code action providers, we have added an optional function ([`CodeActionProvider#resolveCodeAction`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/1fd7ee15d3a2c50547228b08cefc7c13a5a739d2/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L2237-L2252)) which allows to defer the computation of the actual edits a code action is going to make. This should help to reduce the time it takes to provide code actions in the first place.

### New Theme Colors

* `tab.lastPinnedBorder`: Border on the right of the last pinned editor to separate from unpinned editors

## Extension Contributions

### Template String Converter

**[Template String Converter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meganrogge.template-string-converter)** - Converts quotes to backticks when a `$` and `{` are entered within a string in JavaScript and TypeScript files.

![typing a dollar sign then open curly brace within a string converts the quotes to backticks](images/1_50/template-string-converter-extension.gif)

### References Viewlet API

The references viewlet now exports and API that allows its content to be defined by other extensions. Learn more about it here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-references-view/blob/master/src/references-view.d.ts

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Notebook API

The following new and changed APIs are part of the notebooks API proposal

* `NotebookCell#index` - A notebook cell belongs to a notebook document and this new property says at which position in the notebook document a cell sits. This property changes when a cell is moved.
* `TextDocument#notebook` - A property of a text document which signals that it is part of a notebook, as a notebook cell document. It's `undefined` for ordinary documents
* Strict Editing - Notebook documents can only be modified via declarative edits that are either part of a `WorkspaceEdit` and submitted via `NotebookEditor#edit`. This ensures data consitency between extension hosts and the UI

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### New `invalidated` event

A new `invalidated` event has been added to the protocol. This event signals that some state in the debug adapter has changed and requires that the client (frontend) needs to re-render the data previously requested.
Debug adapters do not have to emit the event for runtime changes like "stopped" or thread changes because in these cases the client re-fetches the new state anyway. But the event can be used to refresh the UI after rendering formatting has changed in the debug adapter. Debug adapters should only send the event if a true `supportsInvalidatedEvent` capability was received from the client in the ‘initialize’ request. Mock debug has an [example](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/23fd6bf224234f188eff23eba83b086e1ee5917c/src/mockDebug.ts#L553) for how to use the event.

### Proposal for Conditional Exception support

We are planning to support "Conditional Exceptions" in a future version of VS Code. Since this requires support in the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) (DAP) we've prepared a [proposal for "Conditional Exception" support](https://github.com/microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/issues/137#issuecomment-698211532). If you are a debug extension author and interested in this DAP protocol addition, we'd appreciate your feedback.
