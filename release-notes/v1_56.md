<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.56 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/120585)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22April+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Terminal

### Tabs
The terminal panel now contains a tabs view, hidden by default. It can be displayed or configured using the new `terminal.integrated.tabs` settings.

![The tabs view is a split pane to the right of two split terminals. It contains icons and labels for each terminal instance.](images/1_56/tabs.png)

The terminal dropdown menu has been replaced by a combined plus and dropdown button. The dropdown button allows for quick creation of terminals from configured profiles, access to terminal settings, and selection of default profile.

![When clicked, the dropdown button displays a menu](images/1_56/tabs-dropdown-button.png)

Terminal actions can be taken within the tabs view by right clicking the tab or hovering to display inline actions.

![Right clicking on a tab displays a menu](images/1_56/tabs-menu-right-click.png) ![Hovering the tab item shows inline action icons](images/1_56/tabs-inline-actions.png)

Other actions:
- Double click the empty space to create a new terminal
- Right click the empty space to hide the tabs view or change their location
- Double click the sash to toggle the tabs view width between minimal and one that displays the full terminal titles

We have introduced the concept of status into the terminal, which represents a state the terminal can be in temporarily.

For now, these states include:

- Relaunch needed ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - if the environment variables have changed
- Disconnected üîå (Windows)
  - if the Pty Host goes down
- Bell üîî (Mac/Linux)
  - if the bell is activated and `terminal.integrated.enableBell: true`
  - set the bell duration, in ms, with `terminal.integrated.bellDuration`

Status icons appear to the right of the terminal title in the tabs view. On hover, details of the status and any associated actions are presented.

![On a tab associated with a terminal that requires a relaunch, a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark is to the right of the terminal title](images/1_56/status-icon.png)

### Profile improvements

Last iteration, we introduced [Terminal profiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_55#_terminal-profiles). This iteration, `terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.platform` settings have been added which allow you to set your default profile by providing a name from your configured ones.

Terminal profiles now also support custom `env` and `icon` values.

## Debugging

### Breakpoints view improvements

**Access type is shown for data breakpoints**

For data breakpoints, VS Code now shows the access type ("read", "write", or "access") next to its name in the Breakpoints view.

![The Breakpoints view shows the access types "Read", "Write" and "Access" being rendered next to the breakpoint name](images/1_56/data-breakpoints.png)

**Better status/error reporting for exception breakpoints**

For exception breakpoints, VS Code now shows their individual verification status and detailed reason in the Breakpoints view. If an exception breakpoint cannot be verified (for example because its condition contains a syntax error), it will be grayed out and, on hover, the corresponding error message is shown.

![The Breakpoints view shows disabled exception breakpoints that on hover show the error message](images/1_56/exception-breakpoints.png)

### Other UI improvements

**Alternative behavior for Stop and Disconnect commands**

A debug session is typically stopped via the **Debug: Stop** and the **Debug: Disconnect** command. If the debug session is of type `launch`, the **Stop** command does not only stop the session but it also terminates the debuggee. For `attach` type debug sessions, there is a **Disconnect** command, which stops debugging and resumes execution of the debuggee.

With this release, it is now possible to flip this behavior by pressing the `Alt` modifier while triggering the command from the Debug toolbar. Altering the behavior makes it possible to leave the debuggee running for `launch` type debug sessions, and to terminate the debuggee for `attach` type debug sessions. Apart from using `Alt` with the default commands, it is also possible to access both the **Debug: Stop** and **Debug: Disconnect** commands from the Command Palette for both `launch` and `attach` debug sessions.

Note that the alternative behavior is only available for debug extensions that have opted in to this feature.

**Improved flow for installing missing debug extensions**

We have improved the flow if a user wants to start debugging but hasn't installed the necessary language extension that provides debugging support (like Python or Java). When this happens, VS Code now prompts the user to install the appropriate extension.

![VS Code prompts to install the Python extension if it is missing](images/1_56/python-flow.gif)

**Call stack column stopped indicator**

VS Code now renders the Call Stack column indicator every time a debuggee is stopped on a line. This should help identify where on a line the program is currently stopped.

![An code execution is stopped and a column indicator is rendered in the middle of a line](images/1_56/debug-column.gif)

### Settings

**Inline values are now enabled by default for some languages**

VS Code's debugger UI supports **Inline values** that show variable values **inline** in the editor when stepping through the source code. This feature is based on a generic implementation in VS Code core and so may not be a perfect fit for all languages, even sometimes showing incorrect values because it doesn't understand the underlying source language. For these reasons, the feature is not enabled by default.

With the new extension API, it is now possible for language extensions to provide correct inline value support and we are enabling the **Improved inline values** feature by default.

To enable this feature, the `debug.inlineValues` setting has a new (default) value `auto`. When set to `auto`, inline values are automatically enabled for those languages that have "improved inline value" support (PowerShell and Java will likely be the first languages to implement this feature).

**Debug view displayed on break**

The default value of the `debug.openDebug` setting is now `openOnDebugBreak` so that on every breakpoint hit, VS Code will open the Debug view. The Debug view is also displayed on first session start.

### JavaScript debugging

**Improve discoverability of js-debug diagnostic tool**

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Exception breakpoints are better aligned with regular breakpoints

The `setExceptionBreakpoints` request can now optionally return an array of `Breakpoint`s similar to other `set*Breakpoints` requests. This allows clients to show validation error messages for individual exception breakpoints or filters. Starting with this release, VS Code shows these errors in the Breakpoints view.

### Restart request can now pick up debug configuration changes

The `restart` request now takes a new optional parameter `arguments`, where clients can pass the latest version of a launch or attach configuration. With this addition, a debug adapter can restart the session with up-to-date values from the debug configuration.

### Disconnect debugger and keep debuggee suspended

The `disconnect` request is used to end a debug session and to either continue execution of the debuggee or to terminate it. There is a new option to keep the debuggee in the suspended state after the debugger disconnects. This makes it possible to pick up debugging with a new session.

A debug adapter implementing this feature must announce this with the `supportSuspendDebuggee` capability. A client can use the feature by passing a new optional argument `suspendDebuggee` to the `disconnect` request.

## Extension authoring

* The Command Palette
* The Keyboard Shortcuts editor
* The Keyboard Shortcuts recorder modal
* The "feature contribution" section of an extension's marketplace page

The following customizations are available:

* `keybindingLabel.background`: Keybinding label background color. The keybinding label is used to represent a keyboard shortcut.
* `keybindingLabel.foreground`: Keybinding label foreground color. The keybinding label is used to represent a keyboard shortcut.
* `keybindingLabel.border`: Keybinding label border color. The keybinding label is used to represent a keyboard shortcut.
* `keybindingLabel.bottomBorder`: Keybinding label border bottom color. The keybinding label is used to represent a keyboard shortcut.

## Engineering

### Progress on Electron sandbox

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window ready for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation) features.

Specifically:

* We changed all of the environmental properties needed for a VS Code window to be accessible in a sandboxed renderer.
* We are exploring switching to `iframe` elements instead of `webview` for custom editors by selectively enabling the `iframe` in certain cases where possible.
* We were able to move some of the native module or Node.js requirements we have in the renderer to other processes or remove them entirely.
* We made `windows-process-tree` context-aware.

### Service workers now used to load resource in webview
