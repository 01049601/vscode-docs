# April 2021 (version 1.56)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.56 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/120585)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22April+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Improved action hover feedback

We have changes the mouse hover feedback for actions all around the workbench, to provide a better UX around clickable actions.

![Actions hover feedback is improved with a background color.](images/1_56/actions.gif)

### Untitled editors hint

We have noticed that a lot of new users are not aware that a language has to be set in order to get the full VS Code language support. To help with this problem we have introduced a hint for untitled editors to help users set the correct language mode.  The untitled hint might not be helpful to advanced users so it goes away immediatly as you start typing or you can click on `don't show` to never see it again.

![Untitled editor shows an untitled hint](images/1_56/untitled-hint.png)

### Updated custom dialogs

We have updated our custom dialog styles, which you can enable via `"window.dialogStyle": "custom"`. We now dim the background so there is better focus on the dialog and we are also using our secondary button style when there is more than one action.

![An example of a custom dialog with a dimmed background and secondary buttons](images/1_56/custom-dialogs.png)

You can [theme the secondary button style](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color) by using the following color tokens:

- `button.secondaryBackground`
- `button.secondaryForeground`
- `button.secondaryHoverBackground`

### Auto update only enabled extensions

You can now configure VS Code to auto update only enabled extensions.

![Auto update only enabled extensions](images/1_56/extensions-auto-update.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Light Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

### Experimental Custom Hover support in Activity Bar & Panel

In this milestone we added an experimental support for custom hovers in activity bar & panel. You can enable these custom hovers using the setting `workbench.experimental.useCustomHover`.

![Custom Hover in Activity Bar & Panel](images/1_56/custom-hover.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Light Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

## Terminal

### New terminal picker

Profiles and setting shortcuts have moved out of the dropdown and into a new + button with a dropdown.

![When clicked, the dropdown button displays a menu](images/1_56/tabs-dropdown-button.png)

This also now supports creating new a split terminal based on a non-default profile.

### Profile improvements

Last iteration, we introduced [terminal profiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_55#_terminal-profiles). The terminal now supports setting a default profile with the `terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.<platform>` settings. Environment and icon support was also added to the profiles system:

```json
"terminal.integrated.profiles.windows": {
  "PowerShell": {
    "source": "PowerShell",
    "overrideName": true,
    "icon": "terminal-powershell",
    "env": {
      "TEST_VAR": "value"
    }
  }
},
"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "PowerShell",
```

Going forward this is the recommended way to switch out the default terminal configuration and the `shell` and `shellArgs` settings have been deprecated.

### New keybindings

The terminal received several new default keybindings this release:

- Move to previous tab
  - macOS: cmd+shift+]
  - Linux/Windows: ctrl+pageup
- Move to next tab
  - macOS: cmd+shift+[
  - Linux/Windows: ctrl+pagedown
- Focus tabs view (preview feature)
  - ctrl/cmd+shift+\

As always these defaults can be removed or custom keybindings can be added via the [keybindings system](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).

### Linux selection paste command

The new command `workbench.action.terminal.pasteSelection` is available on Linux to paste into the terminal from the selection clipboard.

## Debugging

### Breakpoints view improvements

**Access type is shown for data breakpoints**

For data breakpoints, VS Code now shows the access type ("read", "write", or "access") next to its name in the Breakpoints view.

![The Breakpoints view shows the access types "Read", "Write" and "Access" being rendered next to the breakpoint name](images/1_56/data-breakpoints.png)

**Better status/error reporting for exception breakpoints**

For exception breakpoints, VS Code now shows their individual verification status and detailed reason in the Breakpoints view. If an exception breakpoint cannot be verified (for example because its condition contains a syntax error), it will be grayed out and, on hover, the corresponding error message is shown.

![The Breakpoints view shows disabled exception breakpoints that on hover show the error message](images/1_56/exception-breakpoints.png)

### Other UI improvements

**Alternative behavior for Stop and Disconnect commands**

A debug session is typically stopped via the **Debug: Stop** and the **Debug: Disconnect** command. If the debug session is of type `launch`, the **Stop** command does not only stop the session but it also terminates the debuggee. For `attach` type debug sessions, there is a **Disconnect** command, which stops debugging and resumes execution of the debuggee.

With this release, it is now possible to flip this behavior by pressing the `Alt` modifier while triggering the command from the Debug toolbar. Altering the behavior makes it possible to leave the debuggee running for `launch` type debug sessions, and to terminate the debuggee for `attach` type debug sessions. Apart from using `Alt` with the default commands, it is also possible to access both the **Debug: Stop** and **Debug: Disconnect** commands from the Command Palette for both `launch` and `attach` debug sessions.

Note that the alternative behavior is only available for debug extensions that have opted in to this feature.

**Improved flow for installing missing debug extensions**

We have improved the flow if a user wants to start debugging but hasn't installed the necessary language extension that provides debugging support (like Python or Java). When this happens, VS Code now prompts the user to install the appropriate extension.

![VS Code prompts to install the Python extension if it is missing](images/1_56/python-flow.gif)

**Call stack column stopped indicator**

VS Code now renders the Call Stack column indicator every time a debuggee is stopped on a line. This should help identify where on a line the program is currently stopped.

![An code execution is stopped and a column indicator is rendered in the middle of a line](images/1_56/debug-column.gif)

**Default custom editor and notebook resolution**

Now in the event that you have two editors which both state they should be your default editor for a resource (i.e an image viewer and an image editor), you will receive a prompt to resolve the conflict.
![A image editor is opened and the user is prompted with a notification to configure their default editor or keep the current one](images/1_56/conflicting-defaults.gif)

### Settings

**Inline values are now enabled by default for some languages**

VS Code's debugger UI supports **Inline values** that show variable values **inline** in the editor when stepping through the source code. This feature is based on a generic implementation in VS Code core and so may not be a perfect fit for all languages, even sometimes showing incorrect values because it doesn't understand the underlying source language. For these reasons, the feature is not enabled by default.

With the new extension API, it is now possible for language extensions to provide correct inline value support and we are enabling the **Improved inline values** feature by default.

To enable this feature, the `debug.inlineValues` setting has a new (default) value `auto`. When set to `auto`, inline values are automatically enabled for those languages that have "improved inline value" support (PowerShell and Java will likely be the first languages to implement this feature).

**Debug view displayed on break**

The default value of the `debug.openDebug` setting is now `openOnDebugBreak` so that on every breakpoint hit, VS Code will open the Debug view. The Debug view is also displayed on first session start.

### JavaScript debugging

**Improve discoverability of js-debug diagnostic tool**

## Languages

### Markdown preview typographer support

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/107328

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Preview features

### Terminal Tabs

Tabs in the terminal is available as a preview feature and can be enabled with the following setting:

```json
"terminal.integrated.tabs.enabled": true
```

![The tabs view is a split pane to the right of two split terminals. It contains icons and labels for each terminal instance.](images/1_56/tabs.png)

When enabled, the new tabs view will only show by default when there is at least 2 terminals. For single terminals the tab is "inlined" into the panel title like so:

![](images/1_56/tabs-single.png)

Each tab supports several actions via the context menu, with split and kill terminal being available on hover.

![Right clicking on a tab displays a menu](images/1_56/tabs-menu-right-click.png)
![Hovering the tab item shows inline action icons](images/1_56/tabs-inline-actions.png)

We've tried to mostly align how the new tabs behave with how the explorer works, here are some of the other behaviors:

- Double clicking the empty space will create a new terminal.
- Double clicking the sash will toggle the tabs view width between the "ideal" size which displays all the titles without truncating and a narrow view that shows only the icons.
- The tabs can be moved to the left side using the `terminal.integrated.tabs.location` setting.
- Various other configuration settings available under `terminal.integrated.tabs`.

### Terminal Statuses

Along with tabs, we have introduced the concept of statuses to the terminal. A terminal can have many statuses, each of which represents a state the terminal can be in temporarily, with the highest severity one being displayed next to the tab. Status icons appear to the right of the terminal title in the tabs view. On hover, details of the status and any associated actions are presented.

![On a tab associated with a terminal that requires a relaunch, a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark is to the right of the terminal title](images/1_56/status-icon.png)

For now, these states are supported:

- Relaunch needed: A warning icon status is used if extensions want to change a terminal's environment.
- Disconnected: A plug icon status is used when the terminal loses its connection with its process.
- Bell: A bell icon appears when the bell is enabled via the `terminal.integrated.enableBell` setting and the terminal bell triggers.

We plan to support task states soon so that task run status is available at a glance even without activating the tab.

### TypeScript 4.3

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Workspace Trust

In last milestone's release notes, we shared our work on Workspace Trust specifically for extension authors. We made great progress this last milestone for both extension API and user experiences. That being said, Workspace Trust will remain disabled for the next milestone, but we would love for you to try it out and provide feedback.

You can enable the feature with the following setting `security.workspace.trust.enabled`. Once enabled, you will see the following dialog when opening folders in VS Code.

![Workspace Trust Startup Dialog](images/1_56/trust-dialog.png)

This dialog is important for allowing the user to make a decision early and understand the impact of their decision. Once you understand the feature, you may wish to customize when you see the dialog using the setting `security.workspace.trust.startupPrompt`.

You can follow the development of Workspace Trust and provide feedback in [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/106488).

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Exception breakpoints are better aligned with regular breakpoints

The `setExceptionBreakpoints` request can now optionally return an array of `Breakpoint`s similar to other `set*Breakpoints` requests. This allows clients to show validation error messages for individual exception breakpoints or filters. Starting with this release, VS Code shows these errors in the Breakpoints view.

### Restart request can now pick up debug configuration changes

The `restart` request now takes a new optional parameter `arguments`, where clients can pass the latest version of a launch or attach configuration. With this addition, a debug adapter can restart the session with up-to-date values from the debug configuration.

### Disconnect debugger and keep debuggee suspended

The `disconnect` request is used to end a debug session and to either continue execution of the debuggee or to terminate it. There is a new option to keep the debuggee in the suspended state after the debugger disconnects. This makes it possible to pick up debugging with a new session.

A debug adapter implementing this feature must announce this with the `supportSuspendDebuggee` capability. A client can use the feature by passing a new optional argument `suspendDebuggee` to the `disconnect` request.

## Extension authoring

### iframes now used for most webviews

Ever since the webview API was first introduced, we've implemented webview using [Electron's `<webview>` tag](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/webview-tag). On the web however, VS Code's webviews are instead implemented using standard `<iframe>` elements since `<webview>` is not available.

We've been exploring migrating desktop versions of VS Code to use `<iframe>` backed webviews for a while, as this will give extensions a more consistent webview enviroment between desktop and web. Migrating off of `<webview>` will also help with our electron sandboxing efforts.

This iteration, we have switched the majority of webviews over to use iframes. The `<webview>` tag is now only used for webviews that enable the find widget, and we plan on migrating to use iframes as well after a bit more engineering work.

This change generally should not cause issues, however there are some corner cases where the behavior of `<iframe>` and `<webview>` elements differ. Be sure to give your extension a quick test pass to verify that everything works as expected.

### Easier inspecting of webviews

One clear benefit of `<iframe>` backed webviews is that they are now much easier to inspect.

If you've worked with webviews previously, you may remember that you had to use the `Developer: Open webview developer tools` command to inspect the contents of your webview. This would open a new dev tools just for your webview.

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

With `<iframe>` backed webviews, you can instead use VS Code's standard developer tools (`Developer: Toggle developer tools`) to inspect webviews:

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

This makes it easy to inspect multiple webviews. The developer tools also no longer close when your webview goes away.

In addition, exceptions and console messages that occur inside of webviews are now printed in the top level developer tools console:

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

You can also use the developer tools to evaluate expressions in a webview's context. After opening VS Code's dev tools with `Developer: Toggle developer tools`, open the console and select the `active-frame` for your webview from the context selector:

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

Overall, being able to use VS Code's standard developer tools should provide a nicer development experience for webviews.

### Improved transfer of ArrayBuffers to and from webviews

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/115807

### CodeActionTriggerKind

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### New theme colors

### Updated codicons

We've added the following new icons to our [codicon library](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels):

- `arrow-swap`
- `copy`
- `debug-line-by-line`
- `filter-filled`
- `person-add`
- `terminal-bash`
- `terminal-cmd`
- `terminal-debian`
- `terminal-linux`
- `terminal-powershell`
- `terminal-tmux`
- `terminal-ubuntu`
- `wand`

![List of updated codicons](images/1_56/codicons.png)

#### Keybinding label colors

Keybinding labels are shown when there is a keybinding associated with a command. Usages of the keybinding label include (but are not limited to):

* The Command Palette
* The Keyboard Shortcuts editor
* The Keyboard Shortcuts recorder modal
* The "feature contribution" section of an extension's marketplace page

The following customizations are available:

* `keybindingLabel.background`: Keybinding label background color. The keybinding label is used to represent a keyboard shortcut.
* `keybindingLabel.foreground`: Keybinding label foreground color. The keybinding label is used to represent a keyboard shortcut.
* `keybindingLabel.border`: Keybinding label border color. The keybinding label is used to represent a keyboard shortcut.
* `keybindingLabel.bottomBorder`: Keybinding label border bottom color. The keybinding label is used to represent a keyboard shortcut.

### Workspace Trust Extension API

Last milestone, we mentioned the work we had been doing on a feature being referred to as Workspace Trust. We asked extension authors to keep an eye on [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/120251) for updates and we continue to do so. The following information and updates can be found in that issue as well.

This milestone we moved the Workspace Trust extension API from proposed to stable. This allowed us to release the first cut of our guide for onboarding your extension to Workspace Trust. The API is small, so here is a quick look.

```ts
export namespace workspace {
  /**
    * When true, the user has explicitly trusted the contents of the workspace.
    */
  export const isTrusted: boolean;
  /**
    * Event that fires when the current workspace has been trusted.
    */
  export const onDidGrantWorkspaceTrust: Event<void>;
}
```

For more details on how to onboard, please check out [the issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/120251).

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

- You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
- You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
- Copy the latest version of the [vscode.proposed.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Native Notebooks

We are preparing large parts of the native notebook API for finalization. We have done numerous little tweaks and also some major changes.

### Notebook Serializer

We added the `NotebookSerializer` API. It provides a simplified way to translate "bytes" into `NotebookData` and vice versa. When you implement this API your notebook will get features, like backup, revert, dirty-state and other, for free. We strongly recommend any extension to adopt this API and we have put the content provider based API to slumbers.

### Notebook Controller

The notebook controller API replaces the kernel provider API. Notebook controllers represented the execution engine of your notebook, e.g. the thing that makes output. Notebooks can no or many controllers and VS Code allows users to select controllers. In return, extensionsare free to create, modify, and remove controllers as their domain model demands.

### Notebook Cell Statusbar

The `NotebookCellStatusBarItemProvider` API replaces the `createCellStatusBarItem` method. It enables extensions to contribute items with labels, icons, and commands, to the status bar at the bottom of every cell editor. It follows the same provider pattern as many other VS Code extension APIs.

## Engineering

### Progress on Electron sandbox

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window ready for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation) features.

Specifically:

* We changed all of the environmental properties needed for a VS Code window to be accessible in a sandboxed renderer.
* We are exploring switching to `iframe` elements instead of `webview` for custom editors by selectively enabling the `iframe` in certain cases where possible.
* We were able to move some of the native module or Node.js requirements we have in the renderer to other processes or remove them entirely.
* We made `windows-process-tree` context-aware.

### Service workers now used to load resource in webview

In desktop VS Code, Webviews now use service workers to load local resources. Web versions of VS Code have always used service workers for this, but previously desktop VS Code was using an [electron protocol](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/protocol).

Using service workers on Desktop lets us better align the behavior or webviews between desktop and web. It also helped us fix a few tricky bugs and let us delete around one thousand lines of code.

While this change should have no impact on the majority of webview extensions, it could cause problems in a few edge cases:

- Extension that make assumptions about how webviews load resources.

    If your extension was using the `vscode-webview-resource:` protocol directly or hard coding other assumptions about resource uri, it may no longer work.

    Instead, make sure you always use `.asWebviewUri` to create uris for resources. Also remember that the format of the returned URI may chance in the future.

- Extension that setting the `src` of an iframe to point to an html file on disk.

    Service workers cannot not see this request so we no longer support this. This was already the case on web, and we don't think this pattern is common.

    The recommended fix is to not use an iframe and to inline the contents of the html file into the webview instead.

### No implicit override enabled in codebase

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Windows installers consolidated in Windows Package Manager

We have updated our [Windows Package Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/) publishing pipeline to publish our user and system installers for `arm64`, and to adopt the [v1 package manifest schema](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/blob/master/doc/ManifestSpecv1.0.md), allowing us to consolidate the user and system installers for `x86`, `x64` and `arm64` into a single manifest. Users can pick between the user and system installers using the `--scope` parameter when [installing](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/install) a package or using the [winget CLI settings]([install](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/install)).
