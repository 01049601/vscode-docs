# April 2021 (version 1.56)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.56 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/120585)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22April+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Debugging

### Breakpoints view improvements

**Access type is shown for data breakpoints**

We now render the access type next to each data breakpoint in the BREAKPOINTS view. Access type can be either "read", "write" or "access".

**Better error reporting for exception filters**

### Other UI improvements

**Alternative behavior for "Debug: Stop" command**

TODO@isidorn: please correct and maybe extend my first attempt with a screencast:

A debug session is typically stopped via the **Debug: Stop** command. If the debug session is of type `launch` the **Stop** command does not only stop the session but it also terminates the debuggee. For `attach` type debug sessions the **Stop** command stops debugging and resumes execution of the debuggee.

With this release it is now possible to flip this behavior by pressing the "Alt" modifier while triggering the command from the debug bar. This makes it possible to leave the debuggee running for `launch` type debug sessions, and to terminate the debuggee for `attach` type debug sessions.

Please note that the alternative behavior is only available for debug extensions that have opted-into the feature.

**Improved flow for installing missing debug extensions**

We have improved the flow if a user wants to debug but missed to install an important language extension that provides debugging (like python or java). In this case we now offer the user to install the appropriate language extension.


![We show a flow of how we offer Python extension to be installed when it is missing](images/1_56/python-flow.gif)

**Call stack column stopped indicator**

We now render the call stack column indicator every time a debuggee is stopped on a line. This should help identify what part of the line the program is currently stopped at.
> For debug adapter extensions that do not support column locations we recommend to return `column = 1` and this decoration will not be rendered.

### Settings

**Inline values are now enabled by default for some languages**

For quite some time VS Code's debugger UI supports the **Inline values** feature that shows variable values _inline_ in the editor when stepping through the code. Since this feature is based on a generic implementation in VS Code core, it is not a perfect fit for all languages and sometimes even shows incorrect values because it doesn't understand the underlying source language. For this reason the feature is not enabled by default.

With the arrival of new extension API, it has now become possible for language extensions to provide correct inline value support and we are enabling the **Improved inline values** feature by default.

For this a new (default) value `auto` for the `debug.inlineValues` setting has been added. With the `auto` setting inline values are automatically enabled for those languages that have "improved inline value" support (most likely the first languages supporting this will be PowerShell and Java).

**Debug view gets shown on break**

We have changed the default value of the `debug.openDebug` setting to be `openOnDebugBreak` so that now on every breakpoint hit we will open the debug view. We will also open the debug view on first session start.


### JavaScript debugging

**Improve discoverability of js-debug diagnostic tool**

TODO@connor

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Exception breakpoints are better aligned with regular breakpoints

The `setExceptionBreakpoints` request can now optionally return an array of `Breakpoint`s as the other `set*Breakpoints` requests do. This allows clients to show validation error messages for individual exception breakpoints or filters. Starting with this release VS Code shows these errors in the Breakpoints view.

### Restart request can now pick up debug configuration changes

The `restart` request now takes a new optional parameter `arguments` where client can pass the latest version of a launch or attach configuration. With this a debug adpter can restart the session with up-to-date values from the debug configuration.

### Disconnect debugger and keep debuggee suspended

The `disconnect` request is used to end a debug session and to either continue execution of the debuggee or to terminate it. Now a new option has been added to keep the debuggee in the suspended state after the debugger disconnects. This makes it possible to pick up debugging with a new session.

A debug adapter implementing this feature must announce this with the `supportSuspendDebuggee` capability. A client can use the feature by passing a new optional argument `suspendDebuggee` to the `disconnect` request.
