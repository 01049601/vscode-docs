## Updated brand icons for macOS Big Sur

[![Brand icons on macOS Big Sur](images/1_55/brand-icon-example.png)](images/1_55/brand-icon-example.png)

We've been working on updating the VS Code brand icons on macOS to match the new visual style of [Big Sur](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/icons-and-images/app-icon/). We've taken feedback from the community (thank you to everyone who responded) and we are happy to release the new logos for Stable and Insiders. We are also using same logo on all platforms.

|Stable|Insiders|Exploration|
|---|---|---|

## Accessibility

### Multi cursor support

We have added initial screen reader support for [multi cursors](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_multiple-selections-multicursor). Whenever a new cursor is added, VS Code now announces it along with the cursor line and column position. VS Code also announces when secondary cursors have been removed. We plan to further improve multi-cursor accessibility as we receive more feedback.

### Lifted limit of 100 lines for screen reader

Thanks to upstream issues being fixed, we have increased the number of lines that a "Say All" command can read. Previously we had a hard limit of 100 lines to be announced by a screen reader at once and thanks to the upstream fix we have now lifted this limit to 1000. Further upstream fixes are needed in order for us to not have any limit at all.

Due to the this the setting `editor.accessibilityPageSize` is now deprecated. We will still support this setting in the next couple of releases, however we plan to fully drop it in the future.

## Workbench

### Improved sash customization

A new `workbench.sash.hoverDelay` setting lets you define the delay for the hover feedback of sashes. The already existing `workbench.sash.size` setting has been improved in order to still provide a large surface grabbing area
in touch devices while keeping the UI clean and lean.

### Improved List/Tree navigation

Lists and Trees now support a custom keyboard navigation mode which behaves more naturally in specific areas such as Notebooks.

Additionally, <kbd>Shift Click</kbd> range selections behave more deterministically.

### Resizing columns in Keyboard Shortcuts Editor

Keyboard shortcuts editor is refactored to use the new table widget thereby allowing users to resize the columns in the editor.

### Extension management improvements

VS Code now detects extensions installed/uninstalled through the VS Code CLI. Extensions can be activated/de-activated in the active window (instance) and will be correctly displayed in the Extensions view.

### Negative text filtering in Problems view

You can now filter problems those do not contain specific text from the Problems view by prepending `!` to the filter text.

### Emmet

The `emmet.extensionsPath` settings now takes in only string arrays, and can be directly edited in the Settings Editor.

## Integrated Terminal

### Terminal profiles

The terminal now support defining profiles which appear in the terminal's dropdown to conveniently launch non-default shells:

![Terminal profiles show up below the terminal processes and above the configuration items](images/1_55/terminal-profiles.png)

VS Code will automatically detect and surface some of the more commonly used shells through this menu but they can also be configured using the `terminal.integrated.profiles.<platform>` settings. With this setting it's possible to add new profiles, change existing profiles and remove default profiles. For example:

```json
"terminal.integrated.profiles.windows": {
  // Add a PowerShell profile that doesn't run the profile
  "PowerShell (No Profile)": {
      // Some sources are available which auto detect complex cases
      "source": "PowerShell",
      "args": ["-NoProfile"],
      // Name the terminal "PowerShell (No Profile)" to differentiate it
      "overrideName": true
  },
  // Remove the builtin Git Bash profile
  "Git Bash": null,
  // Add a Cygwin profile
  "Cygwin": {
    "path": "C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\bash.exe",
    "args": ["--login"]
  }
}
```

The recommended way to initially add a profile is via the **Select Default Profile** command which allows creating profiles based on either an existing profile or other detected shells.

![The Select Default Profile command shows all configured and detected profiles](images/1_55/terminal-profile-selector.png)

### Auto detected WSL profiles and improved defaults on Windows

Along with the new profiles feature, we now auto detect WSL profiles and show them in the list by default, this can be turned off with the `terminal.integrated.useWslProfiles` setting.

Cygwin is also now auto detected and exposed in the **Select Default Profile** command and Git Bash will run as a login shell (running `~/.bash_profile`).

### WebGL renderer is the new default

The terminal first got the experimental WebGL renderer back in the [November 2019 release (1.41)](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_41#_new-experimental-webgl-renderer), which based on numbers measured back then could increase performance by up to 900% and by even more if your environment had issues with rendering using a standard 2d canvas context.

Since then, the WebGL renderer has gradually improved in stability and had its feature gap closed. We decided now is as good a time as any to make the transition but will be watching for any issue reports.

As part of this work we also added some fallback logic, when `"terminal.integrated.rendererType": "auto"`, the following happens:

1. The WebGL renderer will try to start up
2. If it failed, for example due to lack of os/browser support:
   - The canvas renderer will be enabled and the time it takes to render a frame will start to be measured
3. If the first 20 frames are rendering slowly, for example if there are hardware issues or GPU rendering is disabled:
   - The dom renderer will be enabled

In the next release will plan on removing the `rendererType` setting all together in favor of a much more understandable `"terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration": "auto" | "on" | "off"`.

### Seamless terminal relaunching

Last release we introduced automatic relaunching of terminals when an extension wants to change the environment. This release will now prevent the flickering that was caused before when the relaunch occurs, if the output of the new terminal is identical to the last there is no feedback or distractions caused by the relaunch.

There is also a new setting to disable this automatic relaunching all together `terminal.integrated.environmentChangesRelaunch`.

## Debugging

### Improvements to breakpoints

**Inline menu to edit condition and hit count**

We now show an inline menu for editing conditions and hit counts for function breakpoints. Previously the inline edit button would choose automatically what condition to edit, now the menu should make the flow easier and give more control to the user.

![breakpoint condition menu](images/1_55/breakpoint-condition.png)

**Access types of data breakpoints**

Data breakpoints now support more access types to break on:

* Break on Read: breakpoint will be hit every time a variable gets read.
* Break on Access: breakpoint will be hit every time a variable is accessed.

As a reminder, data breakpoints can be added from a context menu in the VARIABLES view and we already supported `Break on Value Change`.

For now, only the Mock Debug extension has (fake) Data Breakpoint support for all three access types, but soon other debug extensions will follow - such as the Java extension.

![break on access types](images/1_55/break-on-value.png)

### Clearing a terminal before launching a debuggee

Some debug extensions allow you to launch debuggees in VS Code's Integrated Terminal. In order to keep the number of Integrated Terminals small, VS Code tries to reuse a terminal if it is not blocked by a still running command. A consequence of this approach is that previous commands and program output will remain visible in the terminal, which is sometimes confusing.

In this release, we've introduced a new feature to automatically clear the Integrated Terminal before starting a new debug session. The feature is controlled by the new setting `debug.terminal.clearBeforeReusing`.

### JavaScript debugging

* Start debugging with stop on entry

**TODO@connor**: F10 and F11 should start debugging with `stopAtEntry:true` #49855

## Preview Features

### Continued improvements to extensible Markdown renderers in Notebooks

We continued improving our support extending the Markdown renderer in Notebooks. Our focus this iteration was improving performance of the new renderers. We also fixed a number of regressions the new renders introduced.

![Emoji and a math formula being rendered in a notebook cell](images/1_55/notebook-math.png)

The new renderers are still disabled by default but we are now more confident that we will be able to enable them soon. You can try out the new extensible Markdown renderers today with the undocumented `notebook.experimental.useMarkdownRenderer: true` setting. After enabling this setting and restarting VS Code, you should be able to use `:emoji:` and KaTeX `$math$` formulas in Markdown cells.

## Contributions to extensions

### Remote Development

Work continues on the [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), which allow you to use a container, remote machine, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_55.md).

## Extension authoring

### Untitled file API for custom editors & Notebooks

Custom editors and Notebooks now include an `untitledDocumentData` property on the open context, which includes the buffer of the data included in the untitled file that the user triggered a **Reopen With** on. This property should be read instead of the URI if populated as the URI doesn't point to a file on disk in the untitled file case.

### Inline values provider API

The proposed Inline values provider API [introduced last milestone](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_54#_inline-value-provider-api) has been finalized and can now be used in extensions published on the Marketplace.

### Quick input options title proposed API

The `QuickPickOptions` passed in to `showQuickPick` and `InputBoxOptions` passed into `showInputBox` now have an optional `title` property that was previously only available in the `createQuickPick` API. This property, when set, displays a title bar on the quick input with the title you specified. This is a proposed API.

### New Copy As submenus

There are two new menu locations, which appear in the UI as a **Copy As** submenu:

* `menuBar/edit/copy` - for the title bar **Edit** menu
* `editor/context/copy` - for the editor context menu

![Copy As submenu](images/1_55/copyas.png)

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### The stopped event can now report the breakpoints that were hit

An optional attribute `hitBreakpointIds` has been added to the stopped event that contains the IDs of the breakpoints that triggered the event.

Note that VS Code does not yet surface this information in any way. We are discussing possible UI ideas in [issue #118743](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/118743).

## Engineering

### Faster Snap launch

The snap package now uses the `lzo` compression algorithm which provides faster launch times. [Learn more here](https://ubuntu.com//blog/snap-speed-improvements-with-new-compression-algorithm).

### Progress on Electron sandbox

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window ready for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation) features.

Specifically:

* We were able to move some of the native module requirements we have in the renderer to other processes.
* We were able to make more components and services available when sandbox option is enabled.
