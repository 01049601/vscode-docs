# March 2021 (version 1.55)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.55 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[March iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/118334)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22March+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

## Integrated Terminal

### Terminal Profiles

New settings `terminal.integrated.profiles.<platform>` define terminal profiles which can be accessed via the terminal dropdown, where `<platform>` is `osx`, `linux`, or `windows`.

Profiles can be modified by setting a custom `path` and optional `args`, `source` to make use of auto-detected `path` and `args`, or `null` to remove the profile from the dropdown.

For example:
```
"PowerShell -NoProfile": {
    "path": "C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell7\pwsh.exe",
    "args": ["-NoProfile"]
}
```

Another optional property, `overrideName` determines whether or not the key will be used as the terminal name, overriding the default detected one.

In the terminal dropdown, `Select Default Shell` has been replaced with `Select Default Profile`. This will now display the configured and detected profiles along with their args.

On Windows, the setting `terminal.integrated.displayDetectedWslProfiles` determines whether or not WSL profiles (such as `Ubuntu`) will be displayed in the dropdown.

### Emmet

`emmet.extensionsPath` now takes in only string arrays, and can be directly edited in the Settings Editor.

## Debugging

### Improved Breakpoint editing
**TODO@isidorn**: Breakpoint inline edit button should be a submenu #115111

### Support for access type of data breakpoints
**TODO@isidorn**: Support for editing 'accessType' property of data breakpoints #113922

### New Setting for clearing a terminal before launching a debuggee.
Some debug extension allow to launch debuggees in VS Code's integrated terminal. In order keep the number of integrated terminals small, VS Code tries to reuse a terminal if it is not blocked by a still running command. A consequence of this approach is that previous commands and program output will remain visible in the terminal which is sometimes confusing.

In this release we've introduced a new feature to automatically clear the integrated terminal before starting a new debug session. The feature is controlled by the new setting `debug.terminal.clearBeforeReusing`.

### JavaScript debugging

* Start debugging with stop on entry<br>
**TODO@connor**: F10 and F11 should start debugging with stopAtEntry:true #49855

## Extension authoring

### Inline values provider API

The proposed Inline values provider API [introduced last milestone](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_54#_inline-value-provider-api) has been finalized and can now be used in extensions published on the Marketplace.

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### The `stopped` event can now report the breakpoints that were hit

An optional attribute `hitBreakpointIds` has been added to the stopped event which contains the ids of the breakpoints that triggered the event.

Please note that VS Code does not yet surface this information in any way. But we are discussing possible UI ideas [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/118743).

## Preview Features

### Continued improvements to extensible markdown renderers in notebooks

We continued improving our support extending the markdown renderer in notebooks. Our focus this iteration was improving performance of the new renderers. We also fixed a number of regressions the new renders introduced.

The new renderers are still disabled by default but we are now more confident that we will be able to enable them soon. You can try out the new extensible Markdown renderers today with the undocumented `notebook.experimental.useMarkdownRenderer: true` setting. After enabling this setting and restarting VS Code, you should be able to use `:emoji:` and KaTeX `$math$` formulas in markdown cells.

## Contributions to extensions

### Remote Development

Work continues on the [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), which allow you to use a container, remote machine, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_55.md).

## Extension authoring

### Untitled file API for custom editors & notebooks

Custom editors and notebooks now include an `untitledDocumentData` property on the open context which includes the buffer of the data included in the untitled file that the user triggered a "Reopen With" on. This should be read instead of the URI if populated as the URI doesn't point to a file on disk in the untitled file case.

## Engineering

### Progress on Electron sandbox

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window ready for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation) features.

Specifically:

* We were able to move some of the native module requirements we have in the renderer to other processes.
* We were able to make more components and services available when sandbox option is enabled.

## Notable fixes
