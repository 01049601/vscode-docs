## Workbench

### Command Center Home

A "home" view was added to the Command Center to make it easy to discover how to navigate to files, run commands, and more.

This short list of modes also provides keybinding hints so that you can jump directly to your most-used modes (e.g. Go to File) without going through the Command Center.

### Settings editor workspace trust and policy indicators

Settings that are not applied due to a restricted workspace or due to being managed under an organization policy now use indicators to display their status. The user can read and write workspace settings even under a restricted workspace (which was always possible using the settings.json file), but the workspace setting value won't be considered when calculating the final value of the setting to use in a restricted workspace.

There have also been a few adjustments to the default light theme, with clearer codicon rendering in the indicators area and tighter focus borders.

### Outline default collapse state

There is a new setting `outline.collapseItems` that controls the default collapse state of outline items. The default value is `false` which means that outline items are expanded by default. Set it to `true` to have outline items collapsed by default. This setting can be set per language and also works for notebooks.

### Shortcuts for including/excluding folders from Search results

When right-clicking a folder in the Search view's search results, there are now two new options in the context menu.

* Selecting **Restrict Search to Folder** adds the selected folder path(s) to the **files to include** textbox. Adding a path to this textbox will limit search results to ones that fit the listed paths or patterns.

_Theme: [GitHub Dark Dimmed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

* Selecting **Exclude Folder from Search** adds the selected folder path(s) to the **files to exclude** textbox. Adding a path here will exclude any search results that fit the listed paths or patterns.

### Rearrange the View menu

In the View menu of the application menubar, the final group was a growing list of editor actions. As a means to balance growth of the menu and functionality, we have moved the primarily appearance-related items under the Appearance submenu. Word Wrap and Sticky Scroll have been left in their original positions.

_Theme: [GitHub Light Default](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

### Rounded Corners on Inputs

Text inputs, text areas, and dropdowns all now feature rounded corners to match the same styling applied to buttons in a previous release.

![Text input with rounded corners](images/1_73/rounded-corners-inputs.png)

### Quick Pick List Style Updates

The list styling used in the quick pick UI has been lightly refreshed with rounded corners and left/right margin.

### Updated Codicons for List Views

Flat list and tree list views now use more legible [codicons](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons).

### Secondary Side Bar foreground color

The Secondary Side Bar mimics the theming of the Primary Side Bar in general, but not all theme keys were being picked up properly. The Secondary Side Bar now properly uses the `"sideBar.foreground"` theme key.

_Theme: [GitHub Light Default](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

### No more 'Too many folding ranges' notifications

For performance reasons, we limit the number of folding ranges shown in the editor to 5000. The limit can be configured by the setting `editor.foldingMaximumRegions`.
When the limit is exceeded we used to show a notification. Instead we now use the language status to show the information.

![folding limit warning in the language status](images/1_73/folding-limit-warning.png)


### Default folding provider

Normally, when there are multiple folding provider contributed to a language, we try to merge the result. If there are conflicting ranges, some ranges are discarded.

Some folding providers are not suited to be combined with others.

The new `editor.defaultFoldingProvider `setting allows to select the folding provider to use. The name of the provider is the name of the extension that provides it.

The following example sets the folding provider from the (hypothetical) extension `aeschli.better-folding` to be used by default for JavaScript.

```
      "[javascript]": {
                "editor.defaultFoldingRangeProvider": "aeschli.better-folding"
        }
```

## Languages

### Markdown automatic link updates on file rename / move

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Markdown insert link commands

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Markdown unused and duplicate link definition diagnostics

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Markdown link occurrence highlighting

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### New Razor syntax highlighting grammar

VS Code has a new, better-maintained, Razor grammar for syntax highlighting of Razor files. The new grammar is actively maintained and fixes issues that existed in the old grammar.

## Preview features

### TypeScript 4.9

<!-- TODO mjbvz; sort imports -->

## VS Code for the Web

### Improved branch creation and protection workflows

When you are in a GitHub or Azure Repos repository on VS Code for the Web, committing to a protected branch now notifies you that the current branch is protected and prompts you to create a new branch.

This flow will also honor the following settings:
- `git.branchPrefix` allows you to prepopulate the branch name quick input with a configured prefix
- `"git.branchProtectionPrompt": "alwaysCommitToNewBranch"` allows you to skip the prompt when you attempt to commit to a protected branch and go straight to the quick input for creating a new branch

In addition, when you create a new branch, you can bypass the prompt about whether to switch to the newly created branch by configuring `"remoteHub.switchToCreatedBranch": "always"`.

All of the above also applies when using the [GitHub Repositories](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.remotehub) or [Azure Repos](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-repositories) extensions on VS Code for the desktop.

## Extension authoring

### Provide metadata for workspace edits

The API to apply a workspace edit now allows to provide metadata, esp for marking the edit as being a refactoring. This will be honoured by the editor and auto-save after refactoring (setting: `files.refactoring.autoSave`) will play along nicely

### Restrict which commands can be run by `MarkdownString` and in webviews

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Webviews try to use the same origin

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Python

### Migration to isort extension

In our May 2022 [release](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-may-2022-release/), we announced a new [isort](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.isort) extension that works alongside the Python extension to sort imports. For example, when you open a file and the imports do not follow isort's standards, it will display an error diagnostic and provide a code action to fix the import order. In this release, we are migrating to use the isort extension instead of isort built-in to the Python extension by automatically installing it alongisde the Python extension.

### Auto imports turned off by default with Pylance

Since auto imports were first implemented in Pylance, we’ve been getting a lot of feedback about how confusing and, sometimes, annoying it could be to have an import automatically added to a file when, for example, suggestions are accepted by accident. Starting this release, packages will no longer be imported automatically by default when using Pylance. If you’d like to re-enable auto imports for your Python projects, you can do so by adding the following setting to your settings.json file ( View > Command Palette… and run “Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)): `"python.analysis.autoImportCompletions": false`, or by looking for ` python.analysis.autoImportCompletions` in the settings UI (File > Preferences > Settings).

### Pylint and flake8 extensions recommendation

In our [previous](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-april-2022-release/#pylint-extension) [releases](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/pvsc-sept-2022/#flake8-extension), we announced new [Pylint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.pylint) and [Flake8](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.flake8) extensions that work in tandem with the Python extension through the Language Server Protocol (LSP) to provide linting. In this release, we’re starting to roll-out a notification that suggests those who are still using the pylint and flake8 features built-in to the Python extension to install these new extensions, as they are our long term planned support for linting.

## Contributions to Extensions

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

Work continues on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. Check out the [changelog for the 0.54.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0540) release of the extension to see the other highlights.

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Static notebook preloads

The new `notebookPreload` proposed contribution point lets extensions contribute scripts that are loaded into notebooks of a specific type.

```jsonc
{
    "contributes": {
        "notebookPreload": [
            {
                "type": "jupyter-notebook", // Type of notebook the preload script should be enabled for
                "entrypoint": "./path/to/preload.js"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

This contribution point is controlled by the `contribNotebookStaticPreloads` api proposal. Extensions can use preloads to load or define globals in the notebook JavaScript environment.

The preload script must be a JavaScript module which exports an `activate` function. All preloads are evaluated before any [renderer scripts](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook#notebook-renderer).

### Notebook renderers can access all output items

[Custom notebook renderers](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook#notebook-renderer) can now access all mime data of the output item it is rendering. If the renderer determines that it cannot render the main output item properly, this API proposal lets it fall back to render one of the other mime types instead.

The entrypoint of this proposal is a new `OutputItem._allOutputItems` property. The is an ordered list of all mime types that the current output item contains. Each item in the list has the shape `{ mime, getItem() }`. `mime` is the mimetype such as `text/html` or `image/png`, while the `getItem()` function returns a promise to an `OutputItem` for that mime type.

Here's how a renderer can use this new api:

```ts
async function renderOutputItem(outputInfo, element, signal){
    const didRender = tryRenderMainItem(outputInfo, element);

	if (!didRender) {
        // Fallback to render `text/html`
		const htmlItem = await outputInfo._allOutputItems.find(item => item.mime === 'text/html')?.getItem();
		if (htmlItem) {
            // Here we can either render the 'text/html' item ourselves or delegate to another renderer
			const renderer = await ctx.getRenderer('vscode.builtin-renderer');
			if (renderer) {
				return renderer.renderOutputItem(htmlItem, element, signal);
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Please give this proposal a try and let us know what you think!


### Extension Telemetry API

To further drive telemetry best practices and enhance the telemetry features extensions have offered to them, this iteration introduces the proposed `telemetryLogger` API. This API allows extension to supply a `TelemetryAppender` which acts as the core sending logic (implemented utilizing [Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-new-resource) or another data recording service). This `TelemetryAppender` is then used to instantiate a `TelemetryLogger` which is the class which you should log telemetry through. The `TelemetryLogger` provides a shared output channel to see sent telemetry events, proper telemetry setting checks, and personally identifiable information cleaning. Additionally any errors thrown by utilizing the VS Code API will be logged to your appender for better error diagnostics. A simple sample can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/blob/d7dd9da34a9849396719408716d468512b5e5abb/telemetry-sample/src/extension.ts) and feedback can be provided [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/160090)

## Engineering

### Optimizing for input latency

As VS Code has grown in size, so has the amount of things we do when a keystroke is pressed. This iteration we stepped back and did a thorough investigation into what exactly happens when you type in the editor and what can we defer until after the keystroke is rendered on screen. The main outcomes of this exploration was:

* Several changes were made to defer as much work as possible until after a keystroke in the editor has been rendered on screen. A rough estimate of the impact of this is a ~15% reduction in input latency when intellisense is not showing, and an even higher reduction when intellisense is being refiltered.
* We now have more refined techniques for manually measuring input latency and optimizing at this sub-millisecond\* level.
* There is a work in progress change that will help us track and report samples of input latency, this will give us some concrete number to maintain and improve against.

This is just the beginning of this effort and we have more changes that should land next release.

\* _These numbers are very dependent upon the hardware that is used to test. A 0.5ms improvement on powerful hardware may end up being 2ms on more average hardware._

### Automatic renderer profiling

The renderer-process of VS Code is responsible for its UI, it ensures a blinking cursor, the ability to type, and to save. Any performance issue in the renderer-process will be visible to the user and is equal to a bad experience. To help us identify and fix performance issues in the renderer-process, we have added a new setting `application.experimental.rendererProfiling` that can be used to automatically profile the renderer-process. The setting can be set to `on` to enable profiling, and `off` to disable profiling. When enabled, the renderer-process will be profiled for a few seconds whenever it "appears as pressured", the profile is then analyzed, anonymized, and sent off for inspection. You can use the window log to follow along with the profiling process.

Note that this feature is currently off by default as we still learn and tune things. Please try it out and let us know what you think.
