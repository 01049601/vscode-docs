# October 2022 (version 1.73)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.73 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22October+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Command Center Home

<!-- TODO @daviddossett -->

### Settings editor workspace trust and policy indicators

Settings that are not applied due to a restricted workspace or due to being managed under an organization policy now use indicators to display their status. The user can read and write workspace settings even under a restricted workspace (which was always possible using the settings.json file), but the workspace setting value won't be considered when calculating the final value of the setting to use in a restricted workspace.

There have also been a few adjustments to the default light theme, with clearer codicon rendering in the indicators area and tighter focus borders.

### Outline default collapse state

There is a new setting `outline.collapseItems` that controls the default collapse state of outline items. The default value is `false` which means that outline items are expanded by default. Set it to `true` to have outline items collapsed by default. This setting can be set per language and also works for notebooks.

### Shortcuts for including/excluding folders from Search results

When right-clicking a folder in the Search view's search results, there are now two new options in the context menu.

* Selecting **Restrict Search to Folder** adds the selected folder path(s) to the **files to include** textbox. Adding a path to this textbox will limit search results to ones that fit the listed paths or patterns.

* Selecting **Exclude Folder from Search** adds the selected folder path(s) to the **files to exclude** textbox. Adding a path here will exclude any search results that fit the listed paths or patterns.

### No more 'Too many folding ranges' notifications

For performance reasons, we limit the number of folding ranges shown in the editor to 5000. The limit can be configured by the setting `editor.foldingMaximumRegions`.
When the limit is exceeded we used to show a notification. Instead we now use the language status to show the information.

### Default folding provider

Normally, when there are multiple folding provider contributed to a language, we try to merge the result. If there are conflicting ranges, some ranges are discarded.

Some folding providers are not suited to be combined with others.

The new `editor.defaultFoldingProvider `setting allows to select the folding provider to use. The name of the provider is the name of the extension that provides it.

The following example sets the folding provider from the (hypothetical) extension `aeschli.better-folding` to be used by default for JavaScript.

```
      "[javascript]": {
                "editor.defaultFoldingRangeProvider": "aeschli.better-folding"
        }
```

## Languages

### Markdown automatic link updates on file rename / move

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Markdown insert link commands

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Markdown unused and duplicate link definition diagnostics

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Markdown link occurrence highlighting

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Preview features

### TypeScript 4.9

<!-- TODO mjbvz; sort imports -->

## Extension authoring

### Provide metadata for workspace edits

The API to apply a workspace edit now allows to provide metadata, esp for marking the edit as being a refactoring. This will be honoured by the editor and auto-save after refactoring (setting: `files.refactoring.autoSave`) will play along nicely

### Restrict which commands can be run by `MarkdownString` and in webviews

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Webviews try to use the same origin

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Static notebook preloads

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Notebook renderers can access all output items

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Engineering

### Optimizing for input latency

As VS Code has grown in size, so has the amount of things we do when a keystroke is pressed. This iteration we stepped back and did a thorough investigation into what exactly happens when you type in the editor and what can we defer until after the keystroke is rendered on screen. The main outcomes of this exploration was:

* Several changes were made to defer as much work as possible until after a keystroke in the editor has been rendered on screen. A rough estimate of the impact of this is a ~15% reduction in input latency when intellisense is not showing, and an even higher reduction when intellisense is being refiltered.
* We now have more refined techniques for manually measuring input latency and optimizing at this sub-millisecond\* level.
* There is a work in progress change that will help us track and report samples of input latency, this will give us some concrete number to maintain and improve against.

This is just the beginning of this effort and we have more changes that should land next release.

\* _These numbers are very dependent upon the hardware that is used to test. A 0.5ms improvement on powerful hardware may end up being 2ms on more average hardware._

### Automatic renderer profiling

The renderer-process of VS Code is responsible for its UI, it ensures a blinking cursor, the ability to type, and to save. Any performance issue in the renderer-process will be visible to the user and is equal to a bad experience. To help us identify and fix performance issues in the renderer-process, we have added a new setting `application.experimental.rendererProfiling` that can be used to automatically profile the renderer-process. The setting can be set to `on` to enable profiling, and `off` to disable profiling. When enabled, the renderer-process will be profiled for a few seconds whenever it "appears as pressured", the profile is then analyzed, anonymized, and sent off for inspection. You can use the window log to follow along with the profiling process.

Note that this feature is currently off by default as we still learn and tune things. Please try it out and let us know what you think.
