Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.73 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22October+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Engineering

### Optimizing for input latency

As VS Code has grown in size, so has the amount of things we do when a keystroke is pressed. This iteration we stepped back and did a thorough investigation into what exactly happens when you type in the editor and what can we defer until after the keystroke is rendered on screen. The main outcomes of this exploration was:

- Several changes were made to defer as much work as possible until after a keystroke in the editor has been rendered on screen. A rough estimate of the impact of this is a ~15% reduction in input latency when intellisense is not showing, and an even higher reduction when intellisense is being refiltered.
- We now have more refined techniques for manually measuring input latency and optimizing at this sub-millisecond\* level.
- There is a work in progress change that will help us track and report samples of input latency, this will give us some concrete number to maintain and improve against.

This is just the beginning of this effort and we have more changes that should land next release.

\* *These numbers are very dependent upon the hardware that is used to test. A 0.5ms improvement on powerful hardware may end up being 2ms on more average hardware.*
