## Extension authoring

### Webview UI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

The Webview UI Toolkit is a component library for building webview-based extensions in Visual Studio Code.

Features of the library include:

- **Implements the Visual Studio Code design language:** create extensions that have a consistent look and feel with the rest of the editor.
- **Automatic support for color themes:** All components are designed with theming in mind and will automatically display the current editor theme.
- **Use any tech stack:** The library ships as a set of web components, meaning developers can use the toolkit no matter what tech stack (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) their extension is built with.
- **Accessible out of the box:** All components ship with web standard compliant ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
