# September 2021 (version 1.61)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.61 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[September iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/132467)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22September+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Indicate deleted and readony editors via decorations

Opened editors support to indicate whether they are readonly or whether their associated resource has been deleted from disk. This indication was given by appending "deleted" and/or "readonly" to the editor label, requiring quite a bit of space.

We now changed to using decorations for this purpose:
* editors with deleted resource appear with strikethrough and in red
* editors with readonly resources appear with a lock icon

### macOS: File menu changes

On macOS if you select the "Open..." menu item from the "File" menu you can open both files and folders. For new users this may come to a surprise, especially since "Open Workspace" was often used to try to open a folder, but that menu item is specifically to open a `.code-workspace` file.

As such we made slight adjustments to the file menu on macOS:
* a new entry "Open Folder..." allows to open a folder
* "Open Workspace..." was renamed to "Open Workspace from File..."

### File watching changes

The file watcher we use to detect changes to files and folders on disk changed to a [library](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-nsfw) that can handle all of our supported platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and as such reduces the overhead of maintaining different watchers for different platforms. We plan to enable this library by default on all platforms. This iteration we enabled it on Windows and macOS, while Linux is planned shortly after.

The new watcher should be faster on startup and result in less CPU cycles spend on large folders. One downside of this benefit though is that the file watcher is no longer automatically detecting folders in a workspace that are symbolic links. If you have such a setup, you can use the new `files.watcherInclude` setting to explicitly add the path of a symbolic link to be included for file watching.

You should not notice any regressions in your day to day work, but if file watching is broken for you, please report an issue back to us. A new setting `files.legacyWatcher` was added to forcefully enable the old watcher in case of problems.


## Extension authoring

### Webview UI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

The Webview UI Toolkit is a component library for building webview-based extensions in Visual Studio Code.

Features of the library include:

- **Implements the Visual Studio Code design language:** create extensions that have a consistent look and feel with the rest of the editor.
- **Automatic support for color themes:** All components are designed with theming in mind and will automatically display the current editor theme.
- **Use any tech stack:** The library ships as a set of web components, meaning developers can use the toolkit no matter what tech stack (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) their extension is built with.
- **Accessible out of the box:** All components ship with web standard compliant ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/inproduct_releasenotes.css"/>

### Enable file system providers to declare a file as readonly

File system providers can now mark individual files as readonly via a new `permissions` property on the `FileStat` by setting the value of the property to `FilePermission.Readonly`. Readonly files are not editable.

**Note:** If all files should be treated readonly, you can use the existing `isReadonly` option when calling `registerFileSystemProvider`.
