## Workbench

### Split an editor without creating a new group

A new command was added that allows to split an editor into 2 sides without requiring a second editor group. This allows to individually work in 2 sides of the same file:

![Split editor in group](images/1_61/split-in-group.gif)

A new setting `workbench.editor.splitInGroupLayout` allows to set the layout for splitting to be either vertical or horizontal.

A bunch of new commands allow to use this new feature via keybindings:
* `workbench.action.splitEditorInGroup`
* `workbench.action.toggleSplitEditorInGroup`
* `workbench.action.joinEditorInGroup`
* `workbench.action.toggleSplitEditorInGroupLayout`

And to navigate between the sides, new commands were added as well:
* `workbench.action.focusFirstSideEditor`
* `workbench.action.focusSecondSideEditor`
* `workbench.action.focusOtherSideEditor`

The new color `sideBySideEditor.border` is used as color for the border to separate the one side from the other.

### Locked editor groups

We introduced [locked editor groups](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_60#_locked-editor-groups) last milestone as experimental new feature. During this milestone the settings experience was improved allowing you to easily select an editor that should lock a group automatically when opening:

![Locked editor group setting](images/1_61/locked-editor-group-setting.png)

The setting is now called `workbench.editor.autoLockGroups`. Similar, the commands related to editor group locking have been renamed and are no longer experimental:
* `workbench.action.lockEditorGroup`
* `workbench.action.unlockEditorGroup`
* `workbench.action.toggleEditorGroupLock`

### Indicate deleted and readony editors via decorations

Opened editors support to indicate whether they are readonly or whether their associated resource has been deleted from disk. This indication was given by appending "deleted" and/or "readonly" to the editor label, requiring quite a bit of space.

We now changed to using decorations for this purpose:
* editors with deleted resource appear with strikethrough and in red
* editors with readonly resources appear with a lock icon

![Editor readonly and deleted decorations](images/1_61/editor-readonly-deleted.png)

### Shorter labels for diff editors

When you compare 2 files, we typically had prefixed the file names with the workspace relative folder path, making it harder to actually see the file names that are compared.

In this release, the folder is now hidden from the label unless both file names are the same, matching what we had already done for normal editor labels.

If both file names are identical, a description is shown that hints at the folder difference:

![Diff editor comparing two files](images/1_61/diff-editor.png)

### Allow to split an editor into an existing group

When you normally split an editor to the side, we open a new editor group, even if an existing group is present to the side. But sometimes you might want to split an editor into a group on the side that is already there.

![Split into existing group](images/1_61/split-into-group.gif)

For that purpose new commands have been added:
* `workbench.action.splitEditorToPreviousGroup`: Split into the previous group
* `workbench.action.splitEditorToNextGroup`: Split into the next group
* `workbench.action.splitEditorToAboveGroup`: Split into the group above the current one
* `workbench.action.splitEditorToBelowGroup`: Split into the group below the current one
* `workbench.action.splitEditorToLeftGroup`: Split into the group to the left of the current one
* `workbench.action.splitEditorToRightGroup`: Split into the group to the right of the current one
* `workbench.action.splitEditorToFirstGroup`: Split into first group
* `workbench.action.splitEditorToLastGroup`: Split into last group

### macOS: File menu changes

On macOS if you select the "Open..." menu item from the "File" menu you can open both files and folders. For new users this may come to a surprise, especially since "Open Workspace" was often used to try to open a folder, but that menu item is specifically to open a `.code-workspace` file.

As such we made slight adjustments to the file menu on macOS:
* a new entry "Open Folder..." allows to open a folder
* "Open Workspace..." was renamed to "Open Workspace from File..."

![macOS File Menu](images/1_61/macos-menu.png)

### File watching changes

The file watcher we use to detect changes to files and folders on disk changed to a [library](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-nsfw) that can handle all of our supported platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and as such reduces the overhead of maintaining different watchers for different platforms. We plan to enable this library by default on all platforms. This iteration we enabled it on Windows and macOS, while Linux is planned shortly after.

The new watcher should be faster on startup and result in less CPU cycles spend on large folders. One downside of this benefit though is that the file watcher is no longer automatically detecting folders in a workspace that are symbolic links on macOS. If you have such a setup, you can use the new `files.watcherInclude` setting to explicitly add the path of a symbolic link to be included for file watching. On the upside, you can use this new setting on Windows to explicitly include symbolic link folders inside the workspace - something that was not possible before on Windows.

You should not notice any regressions in your day to day work, but if file watching is broken for you, please report an issue back to us. A new setting `files.legacyWatcher` was added to forcefully enable the old watcher in case of problems.

## Extension authoring

### Platform specific extensions

Extensions can now publish different VSIXs for each platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) VS Code is running on. We call such extensions  **platform-specific extensions**. Starting with version 1.61.0, VS Code looks for the extension package that matches the current platform.

Platform-specific extensions are useful if your extension has platform-specific libraries or dependencies, so you can control the exact binaries that are included in a platform package. A common use case is the use of **native node modules**.

More about this can be found in our [platform-specific extensions documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#platformspecific-extensions).


### Webview UI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

The Webview UI Toolkit is a component library for building webview-based extensions in Visual Studio Code.

![Webview Toolkit Component Artwork](images/1_61/webview-ui-toolkit-artwork.png)

Features of the library include:

- **Implements the Visual Studio Code design language:** create extensions that have a consistent look and feel with the rest of the editor.
- **Automatic support for color themes:** All components are designed with theming in mind and will automatically display the current editor theme.
- **Use any tech stack:** The library ships as a set of web components, meaning developers can use the toolkit no matter what tech stack (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) their extension is built with.
- **Accessible out of the box:** All components ship with web standard compliant ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.

<!-- In-product release notes styles.  Do not modify without also modifying regex in gulpfile.common.js -->
<a id="scroll-to-top" role="button" title="Scroll to top" aria-label="scroll to top" href="#"><span class="icon"></span></a>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/inproduct_releasenotes.css"/>

### Enable file system providers to declare a file as readonly

File system providers can now mark individual files as readonly via a new `permissions` property on the `FileStat` by setting the value of the property to `FilePermission.Readonly`. Readonly files are not editable.

**Note:** If all files should be treated readonly, you can use the existing `isReadonly` option when calling `registerFileSystemProvider`.

### Type hierarchy

The API proposal for adding type hierarchy providers has been finalized.

### WebviewOptions.enableForms


### Running web extension tests on test data

The [@vscode/test-web node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vscode/test-web) module offers a CLI and API to test web extensions in Chromium, Firefox or Webkit.

New for this milestone is the option `folderPath` that allows to open VS Code for the Web on test data. A in-memory file system contains the resources of the given location so that tests have something to work with.

```sh
vscode-test-web --browserType=chromium --extensionDevelopmentPath=$extensionLocation $testDataLocation
```

### Jupyter

**Debugging**

VS Code now supports full debug features for Jupyter notebooks. To try it out, make sure you have `ipykernel` v6+ installed as your selected kernel, set a breakpoint, and select the **Debug Cell** command.

![Debugging Jupyter notebook](images/1_60/jupyter-debug.gif)

**Remote Debugging**

You can also use Run by Line and debug Jupyter notebooks using remote kernels. To try it out, connect to your remote kernel with the `Jupyter: Specify local or remote Jupyter server for connections` command, make sure you have `ipykernel` v6+ installed as your selected kernel, and use Run by Line or debugging as usual.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

Work continues on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. Checkout the [changelog for the 0.31.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0310) release of the extension to see the highlights.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [vscode.proposed.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### TaskPresentationOptions close property

The `close` property, which is a `presentation` property in the `tasks.json` schema, is available in the `TaskPresentationOptions` API. It functions in the same way as the matching `tasks.json` property by controlling whether the terminal will be closed upon completion of the task.

### Tabs API

An API for reading and manipulating tabs has been added as proposed API. This unblocks common feature requests such as wanting access to the list of open resources when there is not a backing `textDocument`. Please provide any feedback regarding this API [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/133532).

### Kernel preloads now use JavaScript modules

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Settings

### Telemetry Setting Deprecation
`telemetry.enableTelemetry` and `telemetry.enableCrashReporter` have been deprecated in favor of `telemetry.telemetryLevel`. In future iterations the settings will be phased out completely. `telemetry.telemetryLevel` allows higher configuration granulartiy now allowing users to select if they want to only allow error telemetry to be sent. Values of "error" or above will also enable the crash reporter.

## Notable fixes

* [133910](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/133910): Show an error when resolving shell environment fails or is timing out
* [133567](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/133567): accessibility: the labels for the top-level tree nodes in find references all just read "true"
* [133149](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/133149): Task terminal marked failed for info/warning-level problems.
* [133976](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/133976): Allow to open a `.code-workspace` via protocol URL
