# March 2023 (version 1.77)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.77 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[March iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/176147)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22March+2023%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Accessibility

### Terminal accessible buffer improvements

The terminal accessible buffer, which provides screen reader users access to the terminal contents via **Terminal: Focus Accessible Buffer** (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.focusAccessibleBuffer)`) now dynamically updates and remains active until `Escape` or `Tab` are used.

When the accessible buffer is focused in a terminal with shell integration, **Terminal: Navigate Accessible Buffer** (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.navigateAccessibleBuffer)`) enables navigation between terminal commands similar to how editors can be navigated with **Go to Symbol in Editor...**.

### Accept a notification's primary action while keeping current context

To accept a notification's primary action, users have historically needed to navigate to the notification center. **Notifications: Accept Notification Primary Action** (`kb(notification.acceptPrimaryAction')`) runs the primary action without leaving the current context.

## Workbench

### Copy GitHub deeplinks from editor gutter

You can now copy deeplinks for an editor line or range from the editor gutter when working in a GitHub repository. [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) deeplinks for GitHub repositories are available out of the box.

To access GitHub permalinks and HEAD links from the editor gutter, you can install the [GitHub Pull Requests extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github).

</video>

These actions have also been added to the `Share` submenu in the editor tab context menu and explorer context menu.

### Recommend extensions by file content

VS Code can now recommend extensions based on the file content. For example, if you open a Python file that has notebook cells syntax, VS Code will recommend the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension that can render and run these cells appropriately.

## Editor

## Terminal

### Improved tab hover

The terminal tab hover now shows the shell's process ID, the full command line and an improved view of extension environment variable contributions.

![Hovering the terminal tab will reveal details about the terminal, this can be triggered with the keyboard via ctrl/cmd+k, ctrl/cmd+i](./images/1_77/terminal-tab-hover.png)

## Source Control

## Notebooks

### Notebook Find in Output enabled by default

When you open Find Widget in a notebook, it will now search for text in cell inputs and outputs by default. You can turn this off by changing the options in the filter dropdown.

### Format on Save

You can now enable format on save for notebooks. This will format the entire notebook when you save it. You can enable this by setting `notebook.formatOnSave.enabled` to `true`

## Languages

## VS Code for the Web

### `.gitignore` support

This milestone we've added support for `.gitignore` files in GitHub and Azure Repos repositories on VS Code for the Web. In the video below, files which are untracked via `.gitignore` are greyed out in the explorer view and do not appear in the source control view. This also works when using the [GitHub Repositories](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.remotehub) or [Azure Repos](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-repos) extensions to remotely browse repositories on VS Code desktop.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_77.md).

## Contributions to extensions

## Preview features

### Notebook search support for outputs
Last iteration, we introduced global search for formatted notebook content in open notebooks, but only for cell and markdown inputs. This iteration, we have added support for searching notebook outputs. When you have a notebook open, there is a toggle that allows you to customise where you would like to search in a notebook. Enable `search.experimental.notebookSearch` to try this out!

## Extension authoring

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Editor gutter proposed context menu

The `editor/lineNumber/context` proposed menu is anchored to the editor gutter and editor line numbers and provides a way to surface extensions actions that are contextual to a particular line.

To try this out in development, enable the `contribEditorLineNumberMenu` API proposal. Actions contributed to this menu receive the line number in command arguments and can reference the `editorLineNumber` context key in their when clauses. Please leave feedback on the [API proposal issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/175945).
