# November 2021 (version 1.63)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.63 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[November iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/136630)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Find enabled on web

The Find control is now supported inside webviews when VS Code is running in a browser:

![Find widget on github.dev](images/1_63/webview-web-find.png)

Due to limitations with current browser APIs, Find behaves a bit differently than it does on desktop. For example, on web, VS Code can only highlight the current find result. On desktop, all results are highlighted in the current file.

### Preview themes before installing

You can now preview themes available on the Marketplace before installing them. From the Color Themes dropdown (`kb(workbench.action.selectTheme)`), select **Browse Additional Color Themes** to list the Marketplace themes. The VS Code UI will preview the Color Theme as you navigate the dropdown.

![Preview Themes](images/1_63/browse-themes.gif)

Press `kbstyle(Enter)` on a theme entry will install the extension.

### Define order problem navigation

You can now define the order for **Go to Next Problem** (`kb(editor.action.marker.next)`) and **Go to Previous Problem** (`kb(editor.action.marker.prev)`) navigation. In previous versions, the order of navigation was based on severity, going to errors first, then warnings, then the rest. The new **Problems: Sort Order** (`problems.sortOrder`) setting lets you navigate problems by either their `severity` or `position`. When using `"problems.sortOrder": "position"`, a warning on line 5 will be shown before an error on line 13, etc.

## Notebooks

### Adjust the font size in notebooks

The new `notebook.markup.fontSize` setting lets you control the font size of notebook Markdown content.

The default for this setting is 120% of the current editor font size.

### Syntax highlighting in Markdown cells

VS Code now supports syntax highlighting of [fenced codeblocks](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) inside Markdown cells:

![A fenced code block in a notebook with syntax highlighted](images/1_63/notebook-fenced-codeblock.png)

### File links in notebooks

Markdown inside notebooks can now link to other files in the current workspace:

![File links in a Jupyter notebook](images/1_63/notebook-file-links.gif)

Links the start with `/` are resolved relative to the workspace root. Links that start with `./` or just start with a filename are resolved relative to the current notebook.

### Bare http(s) links notebooks

In addition, Markdown text that includes `http` or `https` is now automatically turned into a link:

![A link automatically created from text](images/1_63/notebook-bare-link.png)

This matches the behavior of other notebook renderers, such as JupyterLab.

## Languages

### TypeScript 4.5

### JSON language indicator

When editing in a JSON file, there's now a language indicator that shows whether the content was validated against one or more JSON schemas.

![JSON language selector](images/1_63/json-language-indicator.png)

### JSON schema caching

JSON schemas from the schema store (json.schemastore.org) are now cached locally. This saves network bandwidth and helps when working off-line.

### Emmet Remove Tag command improvement

The **Emmet: Remove Tag** command now removes empty lines around tags if they are the only tags on the line. It also now does not take into account empty lines when calculating the amount to re-indent the lines.

## Contributions to extensions

### Jupyter

**Performance Improvements**

A number of performance improvements have been made to the startup of Jupyter kernels, specifically `Python`. Users who have previously opened a notebook would see a 2x speedup when starting a kernel. Restarting `Python` kernels should also be faster.

For more details on the changes made to improve the performance, you can review the following issues:

* Support pre-warming kernels to improve startup experience of notebooks. ([#7903](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/7903))
* Faster activation of Python environments such as Conda. ([#8342](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/pull/8342))
* Avoid starting default kernel when starting jupyter. ([#8185](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/8185))
* Avoid looking for IPyKernel when we've found it once before. ([#8196](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/8196))
* Avoid unnecessarily searching for `Jupyter` packages when `Jupyter` runtime isn't required to start kernels. ([#8350](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/8350), [#8352](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/8352))

**Improvements in handling kernel failures**

A diagnostic message along with a Quick Fix has been added to warn about the usage of `!pip install` when installing Python packages. The Quick Fix will help users choose the right command `%pip install`.

![Pip Install In Jupyter](images/1_63/pip_install.gif)

A number of improvements have been made to provide better and more meaningful error messages when kernels fail to start or die during execution. Errors are now displayed in the cells outputs along with instructions on how to fix the issue. This ensures that users are aware of the issue and can fix it, in case they miss the error displayed on the bottom right of VS Code.

## Extension authoring

### Updated API proposal structure

We have changed how API-proposals are managed. Before, there was a single file that contained all proposals: `vscode.proposed.d.ts`. This file had grown and it was hard to tell what proposals an extension was using and if a certain proposal was already in the stable API. There is now a file per proposal.

For example:

* [`vscode.proposed.languageStatus.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/d673cdb0ecf1c760f22e0ba5530971e1d91a9d44/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.languageStatus.d.ts) - the language status item proposal
* [`vscode.proposed.tabs.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a4d426a1c2ece4222f1343459d31fe948098b2f6/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.tabs.d.ts) - the editor tabs and tab groups proposed API.

Each proposal has a unique name and extensions need to list those names in their `package.json`. The `enableProposedApi` property is replaced by the new `enabledApiProposals`, which is a string array of proposal names and has IntelliSense and validation support.

![IntelliSense when authoring the enabledApiProposals property](images/1_63/enabled-api-proposals.png)

The updated flow for API proposals should be like this:

1. Find a proposal that you want to try and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

A detailed migration guide and sample migrations can be found in [issue #136964](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/136964). Also note that the restrictions around proposed API usages haven't changed. Extensions using a proposed API cannot be published and cannot be used as-is.

### Quick Pick API improvements

This iteration, we are finalizing a couple related APIs for QuickPick experiences in VS Code.

**QuickPickItem inline buttons**

Being able to provide rich input experiences is a goal of our extension API and using the familiarity of VS Code's quick picks allows for powerful yet simple experiences to emerge. To enable these experiences, we now grant extensions the ability to add buttons to individual `QuickPickItem`s.

![QuickPickItem buttons](images/1_63/quickpickitem-buttons.png)

Clicking on one of these buttons triggers the `onDidTriggerItemButton` event that exists on a `QuickPick` object. We look forward to seeing how you leverage these buttons in your extensions.

**Ability to keep scroll position when updating items**

Alongside the ability to add buttons to `QuickPickItem`s, we also want to be able to keep the scroll position when updating the items. This is a common use case for extensions who want to:

* Implement a "remove this item from the list" (think, Ctrl/Cmd + P `x` QuickPickItemButton)
* Implement a "toggle this item in someway" (think, "Insert Snippet" command)
* Asynchronously loading items in the QuickPick

### Authentication API improvements

This iteration, we are finalizing a couple related APIs for authentication experiences in VS Code.

**Forcing the creation of a new session**

Sometimes, when you get a session using `authentication.getSession()`, it may be valid for some resources but not valid for others and that going through the sign in flow again can fix this.

An example of this is GitHub Single Sign On's SAML support. By default, a token generated for you with with `repo` scope will have the ability to access your own personal repositories. However, if you are in an organization with GitHub's Single Sign On turned on, you will have to explicitly grant a session the ability to access repositories in that organization.

In this example, the GitHub Authentication provider won't know the difference between a token that is properly SAML'd for what you're trying to access or not and so to combat that behavior, you can now force the creation of a new session.

`AuthenticationGetSessionOptions` now has a `forceNewSession` property that lets you ask the user to sign in again. If you set this to `true`, the user will see:

![Forcing sign in](images/1_63/auth-force.png)

And you can specify an object with a `detail` string if you want to show a more descriptive message to the user.

**Silently retrieve a session if an extension has one**

A common pattern we've seen is that some extensions, when they activate, will check to see if they have an authentication session available. If so, they will use it to pre-load data and do other tasks ahead of time to speed up performance later on. The downside of this, previously, was that if a user hasn't given that extension access to an authentication session, a badge would be displayed on the account menu and an item in the menu will be added asking the user to sign in.

This is fine for some cases, but in others, it's not desirable and clutters the screen for the user. To combat this, we've added another new property to the `AuthenticationGetSessionOptions` called `silent` that lets you ask for a session without showing any indication that the extension asked for it. That way, the extension can do what it wants if it has the ability to get a session, but if it doesn't, it doesn't pester the user.

> **Note**: This API will only return an authenticated session if the extension has already been granted access to the session in the past (in other words, it's a "trusted extension"). An extension will never be given a session that the user didn't consent to.

### Settings editor improvements

**Ordered settings**

Individual settings can now be ordered with the `order` field. Ordered settings always come before unordered ones, and the ordering is relative.

**Ungrouped category support**

Settings can also be grouped under the main extension header instead of a specific category. To do that, set the category title to be the same as the extension display name.

Notice in the example below that the **Conf** > **Language** category is directly under the **Configuration Sample** header.

![Settings appearing directly under the extension header](images/1_63/ungrouped-config-settings-editor.png)

**Support for Number and Integer objects**

Objects with non-nullable number/integer values are now supported in the Settings editor.

![An object setting in the Settings editor with number/integer values](images/1_63/numeric-object-settings-editor.png)

### New type signature for executeCommand

In previous versions of VS Code, `vscode.commands.executeCommand` was typed to always return a promise of a potentially undefined value:

```js
export function executeCommand<T>(command: string, ...rest: any[]): Thenable<T | undefined>;
```

However not all commands can return `undefined`. For example, commands that return an array of items usually return an empty array instead of `undefined` if there are no results. In these cases, you had to use an ugly cast or add unnecessary checks to write type correct code.

To fix this, we've updated the typings for `executeCommand` to be more explicit:

```js
export function executeCommand<T = unknown>(command: string, ...rest: any[]): Thenable<T>;
```

This means that if a command can return `undefined`, you must explicitly pass in `| undefined` as part of the type parameter:

```ts
vscode.commands.executeCommand<vscode.CallHierarchyItem | undefined>('vscode.prepareCallHierarchy', ...);
```

This change only effects the typings of `executeCommand` and does not change the behavior of this function.

### Updating vscode.d.ts for strictOptionalProperties

We've updated the typings in `vscode.d.ts` to better support TypeScript's [`strictOptionalProperties` strictness option](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/43947). This work included:

* Clarifying which optional properties can be assigned `undefined`.
* Being more consistent in how we use `?` versus `| undefined`.

If you are using `strictOptionalProperties` with your extension, please let us know if you run into any issues with the `vscode.d.ts` typings.

### HTML custom data from URIs

[Custom data](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-data-extension) allows users and extensions to extend the HTML language support with new HTML tags and attributes.

Now the HTML custom data contribution also accepts document URIs. You can use this to provide the custom data at runtime through a document from a [TextDocumentContentProvider](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/virtual-documents#textdocumentcontentprovider).
