# November 2021 (version 1.63)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.63 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[November iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/136630)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Find enabled enabled on web

The find widget is now supported inside webviews when VS Code is running in a browser:

![Find widget on github.dev](images/1_63/webview-web-find.png)

Due to limitations with current browser APIs, find behaves a bit differently than it does on desktop. For example, on web we can only highlight the current find result. On desktop, we instead highlight all results in the current file.

## Notebooks

### Adjust the markup font size in Notebooks

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

`notebook.markup.fontSize`

### Syntax highlighting in markdown cells

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### File links in notebooks

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Bare http(s) links notebooks

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->


## Languages

### TypeScript 4.5

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Removing of semantic highlighting for older TS versions

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Markdown Preview Custom Editor

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Markdown Preview incremental updating

## Extension authoring

### New type signature for executeCommand

In previous versions of VS Code, `vscode.commands.executeCommand` was typed to always return a promise of a potentially undefined value:

```js
export function executeCommand<T>(command: string, ...rest: any[]): Thenable<T | undefined>;
```

However not all command can return `undefined`. Commands that return an array of items for example usually return an empty array instead of `undefined` if there are no results. In these cases, you had to use an ugly cast or add unnecessary checks to write type correct code.

To fix this, we've updated the typings for `executeCommand` to be more explicit:

```js
export function executeCommand<T = unknown>(command: string, ...rest: any[]): Thenable<T>;
```

This means that if a command can return `undefined`, you must explicitly pass in `| undefined` as part of the type parameter:

```ts
vscode.commands.executeCommand<vscode.CallHierarchyItem | undefined>('vscode.prepareCallHierarchy', ...);
```

This change only effects the typings of `executeCommand` and does not change the behavior of this function.

### Updating vscode.d.ts for strictOptionalProperties

We've updated the typings in `vscode.d.ts` to better support TypeScript's [`strictOptionalProperties` strictness option](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/43947). This work included:

- Clarifying which optional properties can be assigned `undefined`.

- Being more consistent in how we use `?` vs `| undefined`.

If you are using `strictOptionalProperties` with your extension, please let us know if you run into any issues with the `vscode.d.ts` typings.
