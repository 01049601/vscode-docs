# June 2021 (version 1.58)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.58 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/126181)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22June+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Settings editor

This iteration adds support for objects with a fixed number of boolean properties to the Settings editor, by rendering the properties as a list of checkboxes.

![Bool object renderer demo](images/1_58/bool-object-renderer.gif)

This iteration also adds additional support for arrays of enums, by using dropdowns in editing mode instead of plain textboxes.

![Enum array renderer demo](images/1_58/enum-array-renderer.gif)

### Transient workspaces

A transient `.code-workspace` workspace behaves a bit differently than usual workspaces do, specifically:

* Restarting or reloading VS Code will not attempt to open the workspace again.
* Workspaces set as transient do not show up in the list of recently opened workspaces.

Designate a transient workspace by adding the `transient` property set to `true` in the workspace `.code-workspace` file:

```json
{
    "folders": [],
    "transient": true
}
```

## Languages

### TypeScript 4.3.5

We now bundle TS 4.3.5. This minor update fixes a few important bugs, including [auto imports not working in JSX](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/44657).

### Math formula rendering in the Markdown preview

VS Code's [built-in Markdown preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) can now render math equations using [KaTeX](https://katex.org)

![Math rendering in the built-in markdown preview](images/1_58/markdown-math.png)

Inline math equations are wrapped in single dollar signs:

```markdown
Inline math: $x^2$
```

While you can create a math equation block with double dollar signs:

```markdown
Math block:

$$
\displaystyle
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2
\leq
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right)
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$
```

You can set `"markdown.math.enabled": false` to disable this feature.

### Markdown math formula syntax highlighting

We now also support highlighting of math equations in Markdown source:

![Syntax highlighting of a math equation in a markdown file](images/1_58/markdown-math-highlighting.png)

This works both in normal markdown files and in Markdown cells inside notebooks.

## Debugging

### Remember chosen Environment per file

When debugging is started without a `launch.json` file VS Code looks at the active editor and based on the `language` of the active editor decides what debug extension to use. However, for some languages there are multiple fitting debug extensions and in that case we would prompt you to choose. To make starting debugging smoother we are now remembering this choice per active file, so that the next time you start debugging it just starts without any prompts.

![Debug is started first time and the environment prompt is presented. The next time there is no prompt and it just starts](images/1_58/debug-env.gif)


### Debug console suggestions no longer accepted on Enter

The Debug Console suggestions are no longer accepted on `Enter`, but only on `Shift+Enter` and `Tab`. Previously it was very easy to accidently accept a suggestion when a user actually wanted to just evaluate what is already typed in the Debug Console input.

In order to make `Tab` more discoverable as a way to accept suggestions we are now rendering the suggestion status bar in the Debug Console input.

![Debug console input box showing a status bar rendered in the bottom that says "Insert (Tab)"](images/1_58/repl.png)


## Preview Features

### TypeScript 4.4 support

This release includes initial support for the upcoming TypeScript 4.4 release. You can read more about the new language features and improvements in TypeScript 4.4 [on the TypeScript blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-4-beta/).

To start using the TypeScript 4.4 nightly builds, just install the [TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next).

Please share your feedback and let us know if you run into any bugs with TypeScript 4.4.

## Extension authoring

### Detailed completion item labels

We have added new API for more detailed and structured completion item labels. You can now use the [vscode.CompletionItemLabel](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/3cca8288130cb5e0df113571b51c5b62142bb5b0/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L3978-L4001) type for item's labels and it allows you to specify label, details, and description.

These new properties allow language extensions to show signatures or qualifiers but also other completion provider can utilize this. For instance, the Github Pull Request extension now shows full names alongside aliases.

![Completion for Github aliases with full names](images/1_58/completion-item-label.png)

### Details for modal messages

The API for showing modal information, warning, and error messages now allows to provide details. They are less prominent rendered than the actual message.

![A modal dialog with details](images/1_58/modal-and-detail.png)

The dialog above is produced with the following code snippet. Note that detail is only supported for modal messages.

```ts
vscode.window.showInformationMessage('This is the message', {
  modal: true,
  detail: 'This is the detail. Rendered less prominent, but with more space for, well, details.'
});
```

## Contributions to extensions

### Interactive window

We have started working on providing a built-in interactive window experience on top of the notebook ecosystem and the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension has adopted it behind a setting `jupyter.enableNativeInteractiveWindow`. If the feature is enabled, the Jupyter extension will open the built-in editor instead of the webview implementation, when running code from Python files or directly launching from Command Palette. The built-in editor works with your customized keybindings/keymaps or language extensions since it's deeply integrated with the workbench.

## Engineering

### ES2020

We have updated our TypeScript projects to allow using recent JavaScript APIs, like `Promise.allSettled` or `String.replaceAll`. We also output more modern JavaScript, ES2020, which reduces the overall size of our main bundle by a tiny little bit.

### Progress for Electron sandbox support

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window ready for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/sandbox) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation) features.

Specifically:

* We removed our Node.js dependency for loading the resources needed to open VSCode windows in general.
* We added searching to `iframe` elements to get behavior closer to the deprecated `webview` component, allowing us to drop `webview` in the future. This feature can be enabled by setting `"webview.experimental.useIframes": true` in the `settings.json` file.
