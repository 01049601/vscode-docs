Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.58 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/126181)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Transient Workspaces

A transient `.code-workspace` workspace behaves a bit different than usual workspaces do, specifically:
* restarting or reloading will not attempt to open them again
* they do not show up in the list of recently opened workspaces

An example for a transient workspace is:

```json
{
    "folders": [],
    "transient": true
}
```

## Engineering

### Progress for Electron sandbox support

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window ready for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/sandbox) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation) features.

Specifically:

* We removed our node.js dependency for loading the resources needed to open VSCode windows in general.
* We continued making `iframe` as powerful as the deprecated `webview` component allowing us to drop `webview` in the future.

## Notable fixes

* [126702](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/126702): macOS: command line `code .` not working
