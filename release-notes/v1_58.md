# June 2021 (version 1.58)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.58 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/126181)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22June+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Settings Editor

This iteration adds support for objects with a fixed number of boolean properties to the Settings Editor, by rendering the properties as a list of checkboxes.

This iteration also adds additional support for arrays of enums, by using dropdowns in editing mode instead of plain textboxes.

### Transient Workspaces

A transient `.code-workspace` workspace behaves a bit different than usual workspaces do, specifically:
* restarting or reloading will not attempt to open them again
* they do not show up in the list of recently opened workspaces

An example for a transient workspace is:

```json
{
    "folders": [],
    "transient": true
}
```

## Languages

### TypeScript 4.3.5

We now bundle TS 4.3.5. This minor update fixes a few important bugs, including [auto imports not working in JSX](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/44657).

### Math formula rendering in the Markdown preview

VS Code's [built-in Markdown preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) can now render math equations using [KaTeX](https://katex.org)

![Math rendering in the built-in markdown preview](images/1_58/markdown-math.png)

Inline math equations are wrapped in single dollar signs:

```md
Inline math: $x^2$
```

While you can create a math equation block with double dollar signs:

```md
Math block:

$$
\displaystyle
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2
\leq
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right)
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$
```

You can set `"markdown.math.enabled": false` to disable this feature.

### Markdown math formula syntax highlighting

We now also support highlighting of math equations in markdown source:

![Syntax highlighting of a math equation in a markdown file](images/1_58/markdown-math-highlighting.png)

This works both in normal markdown files and in markdown cells inside notebooks.

## Preview Features

### TypeScript 4.4 support

This release includes initial support for the upcoming TypeScript 4.4 release. You can read more about the new language features and improvements in TypeScript 4.4 [on the TypeScript blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-4-beta/).

To start using the TypeScript 4.4 nightly builds, just install the [TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next).

Please share your feedback and let us know if you run into any bugs with TypeScript 4.4.

## Extension authoring

### Detailed completion item labels

We have added new API for more detailed and structured completion item labels. You can now use the [`vscode.CompletionItemLabel`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/3cca8288130cb5e0df113571b51c5b62142bb5b0/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L3978-L4001)-type for item's labels and it allows you to specify label, details, and description.

These new properties allow language extensions to show signatures or qualifiers but also other completion provider can utilize this. For instance, the Github Pull Request extension now shows full names alongside aliases.

![Completion for Github aliases with full names](images/1_58/completion-item-label.png)

### Details for modal messages

The API for showing modal information, warning, and error messages now allows to provide details. They are less prominent rendered than the actual message.


![A modal dialog with details](images/1_58/modal-and-detail.png)

The dialog above is produced with the following code snippet. Note that detail is only supported for modal messages.

```ts
vscode.window.showInformationMessage('This is the message', {
  modal: true,
  detail: 'This is the detail. Rendered less prominent, but with more space for, well, details.'
});
```

## Contributions to extensions

### Interactive Window

We started looking into providing a builtin interactive window experience on top of the notebook ecosystem and the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension has adopted it behind a setting `jupyter.enableNativeInteractiveWindow`. If the feature is enabled, the Jupyter extension will open the builtin editor instead of the webview implementation, when running code from python files or directly launching from command palette. The builtin editor works with your customized keybindings/keymaps or language extensions since it's deeply intergated with the workbench.

## Engineering

### ES2020

We have updated our TypeScript projects to allow using recent JavaScript APIs, like `Promise.allSettled` or `String.replaceAll`. We also output more modern JavaScript, ES2020, which reduces the overall size of our main bundle by a tiny little bit.

### Progress for Electron sandbox support

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window ready for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/sandbox) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation) features.

Specifically:

* We removed our node.js dependency for loading the resources needed to open VSCode windows in general.
* We added searching to `iframe` elements to get behavior closer to the deprecated `webview` component, allowing us to drop `webview` in the future. This feature can be enabled by setting `"webview.experimental.useIframes": true` in the `settings.json` file.

## Notable fixes

* [126702](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/126702): macOS: command line `code .` not working
