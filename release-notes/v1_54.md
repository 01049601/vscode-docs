## Workbench

### Emmet

Thanks to [@jeanp413 (Jean Pierre)](https://github.com/jeanp413), the 'Wrap with Abbreviation' and 'Wrap Individual Lines with Abbreviation' commands have been merged into a single 'Wrap with Abbreviation' command to reduce any confusion over which wrap command to use. Additionally, the 'Wrap with Abbreviation' command now shows the preview whitespace properly.

Thanks to [@lancewl (Hsuan-An Weng Lin)](https://github.com/lancewl), the `emmet.extensionsPath` setting can now also take in an array of paths, rather than just a string. Therefore, when combined with Settings Sync, one can point to different snippet files depending on the machine they are on, without having to update the setting per machine.

## Engineering

### Progress on Electron sandbox

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window fit for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation).

**Specifically:**

* we were able to move some of the native module requirements we have in the renderer to other processes
* the `MessagePort` communication channel was implemented to work when sandbox is enabled

## Notable fixes

* [114881](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/114881): Preserve symlinks when copying folders or files
