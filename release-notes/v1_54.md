Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.54 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/116000)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Engineering

### Progress on Electron sandbox

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window fit for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation).

**Specifically:**

* we were able to move some of the native module requirements we have in the renderer to other processes
* the `MessagePort` communication channel was implemented to work when sandbox is enabled

## Notable fixes

* [114881](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/114881): Preserve symlinks when copying folders or files
