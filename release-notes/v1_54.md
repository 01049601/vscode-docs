# February 2021 (version 1.54)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.54 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/116000)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22February+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Accessibility

**Toolbars and tabs occupy one tab stop**

All toolbars in the workbench now follow the standard navigation behaviour which is that the toolbar occupies only a single position in the tab order, and is navigable with the arrow keys. Thus once the focus is on the toolbar arrow keys should be used to move focus to a specific item in the toolbar. As a result of this change the Workbench has far fewer tab stops making it easier to navigate across all the parts.

For consistency we have done the same change to the tabs area. Thus the whole tab area is only one tab stop, and keyboard navigation between tabs should be done with the left and right arrow keys.

**Word navigation on Windows**

We have improved how word navigation is done on Windows to align with what Screen Readers on Windows expect from an Electron based application. Now when using word navigation each word will be properly read out by the Screen Reader.
Due to this we are deprecating the following commands, they will still work but we might remove them in the future: `cursorWordAccessibilityLeft`, `cursorWordAccessibilityLeftSelect`, `cursorWordAccessibilityRight` and `cursorWordAccessibilityRightSelect`. Non windows platforms already worked as expected so we made no changes there.

**Improved roles for views and buttons**

Based on user feedback we have improved the roles of multiple views and buttons across the workbench. **Activity Bar**, **Side Bar** and **Panel** now have `role:none` which will make the screen reader less chatty. **Manage** and **Accounts** buttons inside the activity bar now properly announce they have a popup.

## Integrated Terminal

### Retain terminal processes on window reload

Local terminal processes are now restored on window reload, such as when an extension install requires a reload. The terminal will be reconnected and the UI state of the terminals will be restored, including the active tab and split terminal relative dimensions.

![In a local window, two split terminals are created and resized. On reload, the layout appears unchanged.](images/1_54/local-terminal-reconnection.gif)

This feature can be disabled by setting `terminal.integrated.enablePersistentSessions` to false.

### Windows performance improvements

Thanks to the [new terminal process layout](#new-terminal-process-layout), frequent pty data events from terminal processes should now processes more quickly. This is expected to impact Windows more than other platforms due to the smaller events provided by conpty on Windows.

### Automatically relaunch terminal requiring environment changes

Recently a new feature was rolled out that enabled extensions to influence the terminal's environment. This is used by various language extensions as well as the built-in git extension to enable VS Code as a git auth provided to negate the need to login. Previously the UX for this was to present a subtle ⚠️ icon in the top right corner to indicate that a terminal's environment was stale. The indicator was quite subtle, since environment changes may or not be important.

We've tweaked this to automatically relaunch terminals that have stale environments when they have not yet been interacted with. This may result in some flickering, but extension terminal integration is much more seamless now. For example, the first terminal in a Remote - WSL window should no longer show a Git auth error, provided the relaunch happened before typing in the terminal.

## Workbench

### Emmet

The **Wrap with Abbreviation** and **Wrap Individual Lines with Abbreviation** commands have been merged into a single **Wrap with Abbreviation** command to reduce any confusion over which wrap command to use. Additionally, the **Wrap with Abbreviation** command now shows the preview whitespace properly.

The `emmet.extensionsPath` setting can now also take in an array of paths, rather than just a string. Therefore, when combined with Settings Sync, one can point to different snippet files depending on the machine they are on, without having to update the setting per machine.

### IntelliSense for context keys

VS Code uses [when](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/when-clause-contexts)-clauses to enable/disable keybindings. Extensions also use when-clauses to control [menu](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.menus)- and [view](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.views)-contributions. Authoring these when-clauses is now much simpler because the editor offers completions for them.

![IntelliSense for context key in keybindings.json](./images/1_54/suggest-when-clause.png)
*Theme: [GitHub Light Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme), Font: FiraCode*

### Open Editors New Untitled File action

We have introduced a `New Untitled File` action in the **Open Editors view** title area.

![New untitled file](./images/1_54/new-untitled-file.png)

### Updated Application Menu Settings

The `window.menuBarVisibility` setting for the application menu visibility has been updated to better reflect the options. Two primary changes have been made.

First, the `default` option for the setting has been renamed to `classic`.

Second, the `Show Menu Bar` entry in the the application menu bar now toggles between the `classic` and `compact` options. To hide it completely, you can update the setting, or use the context menu of the **Activity Bar** when in `compact` mode.


## Debugging

### Help text support for exception filters in the BREAKPOINTS view

Recently we have added support for editing conditions on exception filters in the **Breakpoints view**.
In order to make these conditions more discoverable and their syntax self-explanatory, VS Code now shows a hover on the exception filter and a placeholder text in the condition text box.
Since the information for both is provided by the underlying debug extension, it can be much more specific (and thus helpful) than some generic message.

Since this new feature is based on additions to the Debug Adapter Protocol (see below), it requires an opt-in of debug extensions. In this release only VS Code's built-in JavaScript debugger supports the new feature.

![Breakpoint placeholder](./images/1_54/breakpoint-placeholder.png)


### Other UI improvements

**Improved Enablement for Restart Frame action**

With a new addition to the Debug Adapter Protocol debug extensions are now able to communicate to the VS Code UI whether the "Restart Frame" action is available on a selected stack frame. VS Code now disables the restart frame inline action in the **Call Stack view** for stack frames that can not be restarted.

For example JS-Debug extension has adopted this and now async stack traces disable the restart frame action.

**Setting `debug.console.collapseIdenticalLines`**

We have introduced a setting `debug.console.collapseIdenticalLines`. This setting controls if the debug console should collapse identical lines and show a number of occurrences with a badge. Default is to collapse.

**Setting `debug.saveBeforeStart`**

We have introduced a setting `debug.saveBeforeStart` that controls what editors to save before debugging starts. This setting has the following values:
* `allEditorsInActiveGroup`: Save all editors in the active group. The default value.
* `nonUntitledEditorsInActiveGroup`: Save all editors in the active group except untitled ones.
* `none`: Don't save any editors.

This setting is particularly useful for Powershell debugging since the Powershell debugger supports debugging unsaved files.

**Remove breakpoints inline action**

We have added an inline action X to remove breakpoints in the **Breakpoints view**.. This action should make it easier to remove breakpoints with a single click.

![Breakpoints remove](./images/1_54/breakpoints-x.png)


## Notebooks

### Automatically reload notebook

Notebooks now automatically reload when their file changes on disk and when they don't have unsaved changes. This should make it much simpler to work with notebooks that are under version control.

## Extensions

### Limits for editor title menu and "run"-submenu

The space in the editor toolbar (`editor/title`) is limited. Therefore, we have

* implemented an overflow behavior. When the primary group, that is the group of actions that get rendered with icons, exceeds nine commands then all additional commands overflow into the `...` menu.
* added the `editor/title/run`-submenu. We ask extension authors to contribute run- and debug-commands into this menu, not into the `editor/title`-menu anymore.

![Run drop down menu](./images/1_54/run-menu.png)

Also know that the run-submenu is dyanmic, will replace itself with its first child when that's the only child.

### New feedback channel for the Extension Marketplace

There's a new [public repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vsmarketplace) for issues related to the Extension Marketplace. If you have technical issues, want to give feedback, or have feature requests, please [open an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vsmarketplace/issues).

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [vscode.proposed.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Icon contribution point

The icon contribution point allow extensions to define a new icon by id, along with a default icon.
That icon id can then be used by the extension (or any other extensions that depend on the extension) at the places where ThemeIcon can be used:
In [markdown strings](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e88863d191fed9c81a0087ff225ef7daf79c40b8/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L2516) (`"$(distro-ubuntu)" Ubuntu 20.04"`) and at all places that take a [ThemeIcon](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e88863d191fed9c81a0087ff225ef7daf79c40b8/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L800) ( `new ThemeIcon("distro-ubuntu")`)

Product icon themes can redefine the icon (if they know about the icon id)

See [issue 114942](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/114942) for more details and if you want to give feedback.

### Inline value provider API

Today the **Show Inline Values** feature of VS Code's debugger is based on a generic implementation in VS Code core, and doesn't provide customizability through settings or extensibility via extensions. As a consequence, it is not a perfect fit for all languages and sometimes shows incorrect values because it doesn't understand the underlying source language. For this reason, we are working on an extension API that allows to replace the built-in implementation completely or to replace parts of the implementation with custom code.

In this milestone we've made a first implementation of the [proposed API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/57c918802b88902adc2094d70c8fd3aa29a13102/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L667-L813) available.

Here is the inline values provider API in a nutshell:

* an `InlineValuesProvider` must be registered for a language.
* for a given document the `InlineValuesProvider` must locate all language elements for which inline values should be shown.
* for every element an `InlineValue` descriptor object must be returned which instructs VS Code what information to show. Currently three types of `InlineValue` objects are supported:
  * `InlineValueText`: the complete text to be shown,
  * `InlineValueVariableLookup`: the name of a variable that VS Code will try to lookup in the VARIABLES view to find its value. The name and the value are then shown in the form "name = value",
  * `InlineValueEvaluatableExpression`: an expression that VS Code will send to the debugger for evaluation. The expression and the result are then shown in the form "expression = result".

The following snippet (from [Mock Debug](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/c11887591467730d561ad43e286749a1a96cd874/src/activateMockDebug.ts#L106-L131)) shows a minimal inline values provider for "markdown" files that uses a regular expression to locate "variables" and then instructs VS Code to find their values via the **Variables view**:
```ts
vscode.languages.registerInlineValuesProvider('markdown', {
  provideInlineValues(document: TextDocument, viewport: Range, context: InlineValueContext) : ProviderResult<InlineValue[]> {
    const allValues: InlineValue[] = [];
    for (let l = 0; l <= context.stoppedLocation.end.line; l++) {
      const line = document.lineAt(l);
      var regExp = /local_[ifso]/ig;	// match variables of the form local_i, local_f, Local_i, LOCAL_S...
      do {
        var match = regExp.exec(line.text);
        if (match) {
          const varName = match[0];
          const varRange = new Range(l, match.index, l, match.index + varName.length);
          allValues.push(new InlineValueVariableLookup(varRange, varName));
        }
      } while (match);
    }
    return allValues;
  }
});
```

And now the inline values provider in action:

![debugger shows inline values](images/1_54/inline-values.gif)

If you want to provide feedback for this proposed API, please add comments [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/105690).

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Additional help text properties for ExceptionBreakpointsFilter
Two optional UI attributes `description` and `conditionDescription` have been added to the `ExceptionBreakpointsFilter`.
With these clients can display additional information about exception breakpoints. The `description` property could be displayed in a hover
and the `conditionDescription` could be used as a placeholder text for a text box where the condition can be edited.

### Improved description for `setExceptionBreakpoints` request
We have improved the description of the `setExceptionBreakpoints` request by adding guidance for what an adapter should do if the user inputs an invalid exception breakpoint condition.

### New `canRestart` property for stack frames
A new optional boolean property `canRestart` has been added to the stack frame. It indicated whether the stack frame can be restarted with the `restart` request.
Based on this information a client can enabled or disable a **Restart Frame** context menu action.

## Engineering

### Progress on Electron sandbox

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window fit for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation).

**Specifically:**

* we were able to move some of the native module requirements we have in the renderer to other processes
* the `MessagePort` communication channel was implemented to work when sandbox is enabled

### New terminal process layout

Terminal processes are now spawned under a new "pty host" process, instead of the window process. This change is not only part of the Electron sandbox but should also improve stability and performance of the terminal.

### Windows installers published to Windows Package Manager

Windows user and system installers for `x86` and `x64` are now being published to the [Windows Package Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/). You can use the [winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) tool to search for all Visual Studio Code installers - `winget search vscode`, and [install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/install) any of the published installers.
