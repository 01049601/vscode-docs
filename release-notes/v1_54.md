# February 2021 (version 1.54)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.54 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/116000)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22February+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

## Integrated Terminal

### Restoring terminal UI state
On window reload, the UI state of the reconnected terminals will be restored, displaying the active tab. For each tab, the split dimensions and active terminal will remain the same.

### Emmet

Thanks to [@jeanp413 (Jean Pierre)](https://github.com/jeanp413), the 'Wrap with Abbreviation' and 'Wrap Individual Lines with Abbreviation' commands have been merged into a single 'Wrap with Abbreviation' command to reduce any confusion over which wrap command to use. Additionally, the 'Wrap with Abbreviation' command now shows the preview whitespace properly.

Thanks to [@lancewl (Hsuan-An Weng Lin)](https://github.com/lancewl), the `emmet.extensionsPath` setting can now also take in an array of paths, rather than just a string. Therefore, when combined with Settings Sync, one can point to different snippet files depending on the machine they are on, without having to update the setting per machine.

### IntelliSense for context keys

VS Code uses [when](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/when-clause-contexts)-clauses to enable/disable keybindings. Extensions also use when-clauses to control [menu](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.menus)- and [view](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.views)-contributions. Authoring these when-clauses is now much simpler because the editor offers completions for them.

## Debugging

### Help text support for exception filters in the BREAKPOINTS view

TODO@isisdorn (I wrote the following blurb as an intro for the DAP additions but then noticed that it belongs more to the Debugging section...)

Recently we had added support for editing conditions on exception filters in the BREAKPOINTS view.
In order to make these conditions more discoverable and their syntax self-explanatory, VS Code now shows a hover on the exception filter and a placeholder text in the condition text box.
Since the information for both is provided by the underlying debug extension, it can be much more specific (and thus helpful) than some generic message.

Since this new feature is based on additions to the Debug Adapter Protocol (see below), it requires an opt-in of debug extensions.
In this release only VS Code's built-in JavaScript debugger supports the new feature.

## Notebooks

### Automatically reload notebook

Notebooks now automatically reload when their file changes on disk and when they don't have unsaved changes. This should make it much simpler to work with notebooks that are under version control.

## Extension


### Limits for editor title menu and "run"-submenu

The space in the editor toolbar (`editor/title`) is limited and therefore we have done two things:

1. implemented an overflow behaviour. When the primary group, that is the group of actions that get rendered with icons, exceeds nine commands then all additional commands overflow into the `...` menu.
2. added the `editor/title/run`-submenu. We ask extension authors to contribute run- and debug-commands into this menu, not into the `editor/title`-menu anymore.

![Run drop down menu](./images/1_54/run-menu.png)

Also know that the run-submenu is dyanmic, will replace itself with its first child when that's the only child.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [vscode.proposed.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Inline value provider API

Today the **Show Inline Values** feature of VS Code's debugger is based on a generic implementation in VS Code core, and doesn't provide customizability through settings or extensibility via extensions. As a consequence, it is not a perfect fit for all languages and sometimes shows incorrect values because it doesn't understand the underlying source language. For this reason, we are working on an extension API that allows to replace the built-in implementation completely or to replace parts of the implementation with custom code.

In this milestone we've made a first implementation of the [proposed API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/57c918802b88902adc2094d70c8fd3aa29a13102/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L667-L813) available.

Here is the inline values provider API in a nutshell:

- an `InlineValuesProvider` must be registered for a language.
- for a given document the `InlineValuesProvider` must locate all language elements for which inline values should be shown.
- for every element an `InlineValue` descriptor object must be returned which instructs VS Code what information to show. Currently three types of `InlineValue` objects are supported:
  - `InlineValueText`: the complete text to be shown,
  - `InlineValueVariableLookup`: the name of a variable that VS Code will try to lookup in the VARIABLES view to find its value. The name and the value are then shown in the form "name = value",
  - `InlineValueEvaluatableExpression`: an expression that VS Code will send to the debugger for evaluation. The expression and the result are then shown in the form "expression = result".

The following snippet (from [Mock Debug](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/c11887591467730d561ad43e286749a1a96cd874/src/activateMockDebug.ts#L106-L131)) shows a minimal inline values provider for "markdown" files that uses a regular expression to locate "variables" and then instructs VS Code to find their values via the VARIABLES view:
```ts
vscode.languages.registerInlineValuesProvider('markdown', {
  provideInlineValues(document: TextDocument, viewport: Range, context: InlineValueContext) : ProviderResult<InlineValue[]> {
    const allValues: InlineValue[] = [];
    for (let l = 0; l <= context.stoppedLocation.end.line; l++) {
      const line = document.lineAt(l);
      var regExp = /local_[ifso]/ig;	// match variables of the form local_i, local_f, Local_i, LOCAL_S...
      do {
        var match = regExp.exec(line.text);
        if (match) {
          const varName = match[0];
          const varRange = new Range(l, match.index, l, match.index + varName.length);
          allValues.push(new InlineValueVariableLookup(varRange, varName));
        }
      } while (match);
    }
    return allValues;
  }
});
```

And now the inline values provider in action:

## Debug Adapter Protocol

**Additional help text properties for ExceptionBreakpointsFilter**
Two optional UI attributes `description` and `conditionDescription` have been added to the `ExceptionBreakpointsFilter`.
With these clients can display additional information about exception breakpoints. The `description` property could be displayed in a hover
and the `conditionDescription` could be used as a placeholder text for a text box where the condition can be edited.

**Improved description for `setExceptionBreakpoints` request**
We have improved the description of the `setExceptionBreakpoints` request by adding guidance for what an adapter should do if the user inputs an invalid exception breakpoint condition.

**New `canRestart` property for stack frames**
A new optional boolean property `canRestart` has been added to the stack frame. It indicated whether the stack frame can be restarted with the `restart` request.
Based on this information a client can enabled or disable a "Restart Frame" context menu action.


## Engineering

### Progress on Electron sandbox

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window fit for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation).

**Specifically:**

* we were able to move some of the native module requirements we have in the renderer to other processes
* the `MessagePort` communication channel was implemented to work when sandbox is enabled

## Notable fixes

* [114881](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/114881): Preserve symlinks when copying folders or files
* [116932](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/116932): Throwing custom exceptions from contributed command execution shows cryptic error popup #116932
