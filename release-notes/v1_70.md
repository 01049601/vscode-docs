# July 2022 (version 1.70)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.70 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22July+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench



## Terminal

### Shell integration enabled by default

Shell integration's automatic injection that [was moved out of preview last release](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_69#_shell-integration) is now enabled by default! For supported shell setups (most bash/zsh/pwsh configurations) it should all just work without any change necessary and you should see these command decorations:

![When shell integration is enabled, blue, red and grey circles appear next to commands run in the terminal](images/1_70/terminal-si-intro.png)

_Theme: [Sapphire Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire)_

If the feature doesn't light up automatically you will need to setup [manual installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_manual-installation) which has been [simplified in this release](#_more-shell-integration-configuration-options).

Automatic injection is enabled when the `terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled` setting is set to `true`, add this to your settings.json file to disable the feature:

```json
"terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled": "false"
```

This will disable only VS Code's shell integration injection. Even when disabled, but if your setup has shell integration enabled for some other terminal, [VS Code understands and will pick those up](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_final-term-shell-integration). If you just don't like the command and/or scroll bar decorations [you can disable just those](#_more-shell-integration-configuration-options) while still taking advantage of the [extra functionality](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_features) shell integration brings.

### Simplified shell integration manual install

The previous manual install steps took several steps and were platform and shell specific. The new manual install steps use our `code` CLI to fetch the shell integration script which means it works cross-platform and when connected to a remote window, meaning you can sync it in your dotfiles and it should just work.

```sh
# Manual install on bash
[[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" == "vscode" ]] && . "$(code --locate-shell-integration-path bash)"
```

[See the documentation for how to install for other shells and more information on shell integration.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_manual-installation)

### More shell integration configuration options

The new setting `terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.decorationsEnabled` allows configuring command decorations to display in the `gutter`, the `overviewRuler` or neither. This is available for easy access along with configuring the icons used in the command decoration context menu:

![The command decoration context menu contains the new option Configure Command Decorations](images/1_70/terminal-si-config.png)

### Extended PowerShell keybindings

Additional PowerShell keybindings that weren't possible before due to lack of VT encoding such as `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)` have been added thanks to shell integration! Provided shell integration is working in pwsh, the following keybindings should now work:

- `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)`: Defaults to `MenuComplete` on Windows only
- `kbstyle(Alt+Space)`: Defaults to `SetMark`
- `kbstyle(Shift+Enter)`: Defaults to `AddLine`
- `kbstyle(Shift+End)`: Defaults to `SelectLine`
- `kbstyle(Shift+Home)`: Defaults to `SelectBackwardsLine`

This applies to _all platforms_, even Linux/macOS where those keys are normally possible. The defaults can always be rebound in your pwsh profile with `Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler`. If there are additional keybindings that you expect, [please let us know](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/new).

### Run recent command as a replacement for reverse search

When shell integration is enabled, we're aiming run recent command to be a cross-shell drop in replacement for the shell's reverse search (`kbStyle(Ctrl+r)`). There is a new contiguous search mode which is the default when triggering the command, this behaves like `kbStyle(Ctrl+r)` in most shells, with the option of switching back to fuzzy search:

![Run recent command's contiguous search will match the search term exactly, toggle Fuzzy Search to switch to fuzzy searching](images/1_70/terminal-si-run-recent-command.gif)

The new `inTerminalRunCommandPicker` context key is available which allows setting up a keybinding like `kbStyle(Ctrl+r)` to go to the next match. For example the following keybindings are now a fairly complete drop in replacement for your shell's reverse search, with ctrl+alt+r as a fallback to the old behavior:

```json
{ "key": "ctrl+r",     "command": "workbench.action.terminal.runRecentCommand", "when": "terminalFocus" },
{ "key": "ctrl+alt+r", "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence", "args": { "text": "\u0012"/*^R*/ }, "when": "terminalFocus" },
{ "key": "ctrl+r",     "command": "workbench.action.quickOpenNavigateNextInViewPicker", "when": "inQuickOpen && inTerminalRunCommandPicker" },
```

Multi-line commands now display a new line symbol where appropriate and will also use bracketed paste mode, meaning they are treated as if they were pasted for supporting shells. This typically means they will be added all to the same prompt instead of executing multiple.

![Run recent command now shows the "Return Symbol" unicode character (⏎, U+23CE) to visualize new lines](images/1_70/terminal-si-multi-line.png)

### Other shell integration improvements

Here are the smaller improvements to shell integration:

- Command navigation has improved visual feedback, showing the "focus border" briefly like before and then keeping a persistent rectangle in the gutter to help better orient the user after jumping around the buffer
  ![A solid rectangle the color of your themes focus color now appears to the left of the command being navigated to](images/1_70/terminal-nav-feedback.png)
- The new `workbench.action.terminal.copyLastCommand` command is available to allow a keybinding to copy the last command's output (shortcut for `kbStyle(Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Up)`, `kbStyle(Ctrl/Cmd+C)`, `kbStyle(Escape)`, `kbStyle(Ctrl/Cmd+End)`).
- Bash shell integration
  - More `$PROMPT_COMMAND` formats are supported.
  - Shell integration should work even better when the [`bash-preexec`](https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec) helper is being used already.

### Rendering improvements

Several improvements were made to terminal rendering when GPU acceleration is enabled this release:

- Semi-circle powerline symbols are now custom rendered. Like the arrow symbols in the previous release, these should blend seamlessly with adjacent cells and extend to the height of the cell even when line height is used.

  ![Semi-circle powerline symbols now render without needing to configure a font](images/1_70/terminal-semi-circle.png)
- Round cornered box drawing characters (`╭`, `╮`, `╰`, `╯`) now use a smoother curve.

  ![These round corner symbols now use render as perfect 1/4 circles](images/1_70/terminal-curve-render.png)
- Improved clipping of glyphs when background color changes, this was commonly seen when `npm` output a warning.

  ![Wide characters like W used to sometimes escape the background of a cell, when the background of the text was yellow the W in "WARN" for example could show unexpected yellow pixels in the top left which no longer happens](images/1_70/terminal-render-clip.png)
- Similar to the clipping problem above, an issue where the anti-aliasing in some glyphs would overlap other characters could really degrade the visuals. This problem is most easily illustrated using a background example like above. A pixel in the `k` of `Work` could also escape the bounds of the cell in the other direction, this pixel will no longer appear in the glyph at all since it's removed for being essentially the same color as the background.

  ![A pixel in `k` could overlap with the cell to the right, in this case that pixel may not be rendered at all if the difference in color and the background is small](images/1_70/terminal-render-px.png)

## Extension Authoring

### 'not in' operator for 'when' clauses

There is an operator that already exists for when clauses, `in`, which allows for dynamic lookup of a context key's value within another context key with an array or object-type value. We've added a new operator `not in`, which negates this. See [this operator's documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/when-clause-contexts#in-and-not-in-conditional-operators) for details.


## Debug Adapter Protocol

### 'argsCanBeInterpretedByShell' for RunInTerminalRequest

The `RunInTerminalRequest` supports a new property, `argsCanBeInterpretedByShell`, which tells the client whether special shell characters in the command `args` should be left unescaped. This is to enable users to write launch configs that will start in a terminal, and include characters that should be interpreted by the shell.
