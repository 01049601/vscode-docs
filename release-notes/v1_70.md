# July 2022 (version 1.70)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.70 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22July+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Fold Selection

The command `Create Manual Folding Ranges from Selection` creates a folding range from the currently selected lines and collapses it. That range is called a *manual* folding range that goes on top of the ranges computed by folding providers.
Manual folding ranges can be removed again with the command `Remove Manual Folding Ranges`.

![manual folding ranges](./images/1_70/manual-folding-range.gif)

### Preserve folded ranges

VS Code now keeps folded ranges, even if the folding range is no longer part of the ranges computed by a folding provider. An typical example is when the user comments out the file, starts a string literal, or creates a syntax error that makes it impossible to create all the ranges. Such folded ranges are becoming 'recovered' ranges. They are removed once the folding provider comes back with ranges at the same locationor by using the command `Remove Manual Folding Ranges`.

![restored folding ranges](./images/1_70/restored-folding-ranges.gif)

### Hide folding controls

The folding controls in the gutter can now be hidden with the setting `"editor.showFoldingControls": "never"`. Folding ranges can still be exapnded and collapsed using the folding commands and shortcuts.

### New command line option --merge

You can now use command line options to bring up the merge editor in VS Code:

```bash
-m --merge <path1> <path2> <base> <result> Perform a three-way merge by providing paths for two modified versions of a file, the common origin of both modified versions and the output file to save merge results.
```

This enables to use VS Code as merge tool for Git, for example, if you configure this in the `.gitconfig`:

```properties
[merge]
	tool = code-insiders
[mergetool "code-insiders"]
	cmd = code-insiders --wait --merge $REMOTE $LOCAL $BASE $MERGED
```

## Terminal

### Shell integration enabled by default

Shell integration's automatic injection that [was moved out of preview last release](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_69#_shell-integration) is now enabled by default! For supported shell setups (most bash/zsh/pwsh configurations) it should all just work without any change necessary and you should see these command decorations:

![When shell integration is enabled, blue, red and grey circles appear next to commands run in the terminal](images/1_70/terminal-si-intro.png)

_Theme: [Sapphire Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire)_

If the feature doesn't light up automatically, you will need to set up [manual installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_manual-installation), which has been [simplified in this release](#more-shell-integration-configuration-options).

Automatic injection is enabled when the `terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled` setting is set to `true`, add this to your `settings.json` file to disable the feature:

```json
"terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled": "false"
```

This will disable only VS Code's shell integration injection. Even when disabled, if your setup has shell integration enabled for some other terminal, [VS Code understands and will pick those up](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_final-term-shell-integration). If you just don't like the command and/or scroll bar decorations [you can disable just those](#_more-shell-integration-configuration-options) while still taking advantage of the [extra functionality](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_features) shell integration brings.

### Simplified shell integration manual install

The previous manual install steps took several steps and were platform and shell specific. The new manual install steps use our `code` CLI to fetch the shell integration script which means it works cross-platform and when connected to a remote window, meaning you can sync it in your dotfiles and it should just work.

```sh
# Manual install on bash
[[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" == "vscode" ]] && . "$(code --locate-shell-integration-path bash)"
```

You can read more about how to install for other shells and more information at [Terminal shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_manual-installation).

### More shell integration configuration options

The new setting `terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.decorationsEnabled` allows configuring command decorations to display in the `gutter`, the `overviewRuler` or neither. This is available for easy access along with configuring the icons used in the command decoration context menu:

![The command decoration context menu contains the new option Configure Command Decorations](images/1_70/terminal-si-config.png)

### Extended PowerShell keybindings

Additional PowerShell keybindings that weren't possible before due to lack of VT encoding such as `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)` have been added thanks to shell integration! Provided shell integration is working in pwsh, the following keybindings should now work:

* `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)`: Defaults to `MenuComplete` on Windows only
* `kbstyle(Alt+Space)`: Defaults to `SetMark`
* `kbstyle(Shift+Enter)`: Defaults to `AddLine`
* `kbstyle(Shift+End)`: Defaults to `SelectLine`
* `kbstyle(Shift+Home)`: Defaults to `SelectBackwardsLine`

This applies to **all platforms**, even Linux/macOS where those keys are normally possible. The defaults can always be rebound in your pwsh profile with `Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler`. If there are additional keybindings that you expect, [please let us know](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/new).

### Run recent command as a replacement for reverse search

When shell integration is enabled, we're aiming run recent command to be a cross-shell drop in replacement for the shell's reverse search (`kbStyle(Ctrl+r)`). There is a new contiguous search mode which is the default when triggering the command, this behaves like `kbStyle(Ctrl+r)` in most shells, with the option of switching back to fuzzy search:

![Run recent command's contiguous search will match the search term exactly, toggle Fuzzy Search to switch to fuzzy searching](images/1_70/terminal-si-run-recent-command.gif)

The new `inTerminalRunCommandPicker` context key is available which allows setting up a keybinding like `kbStyle(Ctrl+r)` to go to the next match. For example the following keybindings are now a fairly complete drop in replacement for your shell's reverse search, with ctrl+alt+r as a fallback to the old behavior:

```json
{ "key": "ctrl+r",     "command": "workbench.action.terminal.runRecentCommand", "when": "terminalFocus" },
{ "key": "ctrl+alt+r", "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence", "args": { "text": "\u0012"/*^R*/ }, "when": "terminalFocus" },
{ "key": "ctrl+r",     "command": "workbench.action.quickOpenNavigateNextInViewPicker", "when": "inQuickOpen && inTerminalRunCommandPicker" },
```

Multi-line commands now display a new line symbol where appropriate and will also use bracketed paste mode, meaning they are treated as if they were pasted for supporting shells. This typically means they will be added all to the same prompt instead of executing multiple.

![Run recent command now shows the "Return Symbol" unicode character (⏎, U+23CE) to visualize new lines](images/1_70/terminal-si-multi-line.png)

### Other shell integration improvements

Here are the smaller improvements to shell integration:

* Command navigation has improved visual feedback, showing the "focus border" briefly like before and then keeping a persistent rectangle in the gutter to help better orient the user after jumping around the buffer
  ![A solid rectangle the color of your themes focus color now appears to the left of the command being navigated to](images/1_70/terminal-nav-feedback.png)
* The new `workbench.action.terminal.copyLastCommand` command is available to allow a keybinding to copy the last command's output (shortcut for `kbStyle(Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Up)`, `kbStyle(Ctrl/Cmd+C)`, `kbStyle(Escape)`, `kbStyle(Ctrl/Cmd+End)`).
* Bash shell integration
  * More `$PROMPT_COMMAND` formats are supported.
  * Shell integration should work even better when the [`bash-preexec`](https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec) helper is being used already.

### Rendering improvements

Several improvements were made to terminal rendering when GPU acceleration is enabled this release:

* Semi-circle powerline symbols are now custom rendered. Like the arrow symbols in the previous release, these should blend seamlessly with adjacent cells and extend to the height of the cell even when line height is used.

  ![Semi-circle powerline symbols now render without needing to configure a font](images/1_70/terminal-semi-circle.png)

* Round cornered box drawing characters (`╭`, `╮`, `╰`, `╯`) now use a smoother curve.

  ![These round corner symbols now use render as perfect 1/4 circles](images/1_70/terminal-curve-render.png)

* Improved clipping of glyphs when background color changes, this was commonly seen when `npm` output a warning.

  ![Wide characters like W used to sometimes escape the background of a cell, when the background of the text was yellow the W in "WARN" for example could show unexpected yellow pixels in the top left which no longer happens](images/1_70/terminal-render-clip.png)

* Similar to the clipping problem above, an issue where the anti-aliasing in some glyphs would overlap other characters could really degrade the visuals. This problem is most easily illustrated using a background example like above. A pixel in the `k` of `Work` could also escape the bounds of the cell in the other direction, this pixel will no longer appear in the glyph at all since it's removed for being essentially the same color as the background.

  ![A pixel in `k` could overlap with the cell to the right, in this case that pixel may not be rendered at all if the difference in color and the background is small](images/1_70/terminal-render-px.png)

### Default color and icon tab settings

TODO@meganrogge: Example of multi-root repo

## Tasks

### Task reconnection

TODO@meganrogge: Should this be experimental with a setting and in preview features?

### Filter support for run task command

TODO@meganrogge

### Improved automatic tasks flow

TODO@meganrogge: Call out how trusted workspaces allowed us to change to a regular setting?

## Source Control

### Action button improvements

We continued to polish the source control action button based on user feedback:
* The "Sync Changes" action button is only shown when there is a high degree of certainty that the local branch is either ahead or behind the remote tracking branch.
* The "Commit" action button is only enabled based on the list of changed resources while factoring in the smart commit settings - `git.enableSmartCommit`, `git.suggestSmartCommit`, `git.smartCommitChanges`.
* The "Commit" action button icon is updated based on the branch protection settings - `git.branchProtection`, `git.branchProtectionPrompt`.

### Improved rebase conflict resolution

This milestone we have addressed some paper cuts in the rebase flow while resolving merge conflicts. Following this release users should be able to continue the rebase operation using the "Commit" button in the "Source Control" view after resolving all merge conflicts.

### Commit input field spell checking

This milestone we have validated that all the necessary extension APIs are available to enable spell checking for the commit input field. We have reached out to the authors of two popular spell checking extension and submitted pull requests illustrating how to update their extensions to enabled spell checking for the commit input field.

## Debugging

### Javascript debugging

When you create a launch config to debug a JS/TS program, you can set `"console": "integratedTerminal"` to run that program in a terminal (rather than the process being spawned directly). A few months ago, we noticed that `"args"` in the launch config were partly escaped for the shell, but not entirely. This meant that attempting to pass an argument to your program could accidentally trigger special behavior in your shell. We cleaned this up, then realized that setting args that include characters with special meanings for the shell is a useful thing to do, and that some users were relying on this behavior. We debated the correct fix and decided that this behavior should be opt-in, and that changes to DAP were required. We have made [this change to DAP](#argsCanBeInterpretedByShell-for-RunInTerminalRequest), implemented it in VS Code and in js-debug, and other debug adapters should be soon to follow.

Here's how to use the new behavior in a node launch config.

```jsonc
{
    "type": "node",
    "console": "integratedTerminal",
    ...

    // If you pass args as a single string, the characters will not be escaped for the terminal, so the
    // command in backticks will be evaluated, and output will be redirected to "outfile". The user is
    // responsible for knowing the type of shell that this will be run in, and doing any escaping necessary.
    "args": "`echo hello` > outfile",

    // If you pass args as an array, the characters will be escaped for the terminal so that the program
    // receives them verbatim.
    "args": ["`echo hello` > outfile"]
}
```


## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Experimental extension: WWBD

We have created an experimental extension named [WWBD](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brettcannon.wwbd) to act as a sandbox for environment workflow ideas. As of now we are experimenting with a **Create Environment** command for virtual environments to see if a single command can help users set up a new virtual environment (see the extension page for the full details and other extension features). Please see the [Ideas category](https://github.com/brettcannon/WWBD/discussions/categories/ideas) in the project repository for what ideas we are considering, including conda support.

## Preview features

### TypeScript 4.8 support

This update includes support for the upcoming TypeScript 4.8 release. See the [TypeScript 4.8 iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/49074) for more details on what the TypeScript team is currently working on.

To start using the TypeScript 4.8 nightly builds, install the [TypeScript Nightly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) extension.

## Extension Authoring

### 'not in' operator for 'when' clauses

There is an operator that already exists for when clauses, `in`, which allows for dynamic lookup of a context key's value within another context key with an array or object-type value. We've added a new operator `not in`, which negates this. See [this operator's documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/when-clause-contexts#in-and-not-in-conditional-operators) for details.

### htmlLanguageParticipants contribution point

A new contribution point `htmlLanguageParticipants` allows HTML-like languages to declare that they want to inherit all HTML language server features such as code completions, hovers and outline. This is useful for languages that don't want to implement an full language server.

An example is the built-in `handlebars` extension that now declares in its `package.json` :

```json
"contributes": {
  "htmlLanguageParticipants": [
     {
       "languageId": "handlebars"
      }
    ]
}
```

The [Quarkus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-quarkus) extension has already adopted the contribution point. It enriches the HTML features with additional proposals for the embedded [Qute](https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference) HTML template language:

![Qute HTML participant](images/1_70/qute-html-participant.gif)

### Drop into editor API

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Webview context menus

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### 'argsCanBeInterpretedByShell' for RunInTerminalRequest

The `RunInTerminalRequest` supports a new property, `argsCanBeInterpretedByShell`, which tells the client whether special shell characters in the command `args` should be left unescaped. This is to enable users to write launch configs that will start in a terminal, and include characters that should be interpreted by the shell.

## Engineering

### Progress for Electron sandbox support

This milestone we made substantial progress on eventually enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/sandbox) by default. We plan on enabling sandbox in August for Insiders and eventually make it the default in Stable VS Code.

For the curious out there, configuring `"window.experimental.useSandbox": true` in settings will enable sandbox mode. You should not notice anything changing hopefully, but if you find issues, please report them back to us!

### Markdown language server

### Extensible html notebook renderer

## Documentation and extensions

### Azure Developer CLI (azd)

The [Azure Developer CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli) and its complementary [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azure-dev) are now in public preview. The Azure Developer CLI (azd) accelerates the time it takes you to get from your local development environment to Azure by providing developer-friendly commands that map to key stages in your workflow: code, build, deploy, monitor, repeat.

![Azure Developer CLI extension](images/1_70/azure-dev-cli-extension.png)

The Azure Developer CLI uses [extensible templates](https://github.com/topics/azd-templates) that include everything you need to get an application up and running in Azure. The templates include best practices, application code and reusable infrastructure as code assets.  More than that, they cover end-to-end scenarios that go far past "Hello World!".

With the Azure Developer CLI, you can initialize, provision, and deploy an application, or better yet, use `'azd up'` to do so in one step! For a list of supported `azd` commands, see the [Developer CLI reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/reference).
