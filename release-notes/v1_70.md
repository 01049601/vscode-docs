<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.70 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22July+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Extension Authoring

### 'not in' operator for 'when' clauses

There is an operator that already exists for when clauses, `in`, which allows for dynamic lookup of a context key's value within another context key with an array or object-type value. We've added a new operator `not in`, which negates this. See [this operator's documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/when-clause-contexts#in-and-not-in-conditional-operators) for details.


## Debug Adapter Protocol

### 'argsCanBeInterpretedByShell' for RunInTerminalRequest

The `RunInTerminalRequest` supports a new property, `argsCanBeInterpretedByShell`, which tells the client whether special shell characters in the command `args` should be left unescaped. This is to enable users to write launch configs that will start in a terminal, and include characters that should be interpreted by the shell.
