Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.59 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

## Workbench

### Automatically fold imports

Use the setting `editor.foldingImportsByDefault` to have import statements automatically folded. The fold state is stored once a file has been opened once.
The feature works with TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, C# and C++ and with all language that have a folding range provider that annotates import statements with `FoldingRangeKind.Imports`.

### Navigate between folding ranges

There are new commands to set the cursor location to a corresponding fold:

* **Go to Next Fold**
* **Go to Previous Fold**
* **Go to Parent Fold**

The commands currently have no default keybindings but you can add you own keyboard shortcuts via **Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts** (`kb(workbench.action.openGlobalKeybindings)`).

### Extended theme customisation syntax

The color customization settings allow users to customize colors of the current theme:

* `workbench.colorCustomizations`
* `editor.tokenColorCustomizations`
* `editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations`

There is new syntax to customize multiple themes at once:

```json
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "[Abyss][Red]": {
            "activityBar.background": "#ff0000"
        },
        "[Monokai*]": {
            "activityBar.background": "#ff0000"
        }
    },
```

Multiple themes can be listed as well as the `*` wildcard character can be used at the beginning and the end of the name.

### Settings Editor

The settings editor now supports validation on objects. The validation includes type errors that can be introduced when editing the JSON file directly.

Array settings now have drag and drop support, as long as none of the items are in edit mode:

Moreover, enum array settings now only show remaining options rather than all options.

### Rich Status bar hover

Rich hovers including links and icons are now supported on Status bar items `StatusBarItem.tooltip: string | IMarkdownString`

![Rich Status bar hover](images/1_59/rich-statusbar-hover.png)

* If `MarkdownString.supportThemeIcons` is true, you can use icons with the `$(iconName)` syntax.
* If the `MarkdownString` is trusted, you can also add command links. Syntax: `([test](command:vscode.newWindow))`

### Status bar warning colors

Status bar items that represent warnings can use the newly added colors `statusBarItem.warningBackground` and `statusBarItem.warningForeground`.

<!-- In-product release notes styles.  Do not modify without also modifying regex in gulpfile.common.js -->
<a id="scroll-to-top" role="button" title="Scroll to top" aria-label="scroll to top" href="#"><span class="icon"></span></a>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/inproduct_releasenotes.css"/>

### Object settings without `additionalProperties`

Object settings without `additionalProperties` set to either `false` or an object will not be supported in the settings editor, due to the setting being able to take on any shape.
