## Workbench

### Automatically fold imports

Use the setting `editor.foldingImportsByDefault` to have import statements automatically folded. The fold state is stored once a file has been opened once.
The feature works with TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, C# and C++ and with all language that have a folding range provider that annotates import statements with `FoldingRangeKind.Imports`.

### Navigate between folding ranges

There are new commands to set the cursor location to a corresponding fold:

* **Go to Next Fold**
* **Go to Previous Fold**
* **Go to Parent Fold**

The commands currently have no default keybindings but you can add you own keyboard shortcuts via **Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts** (`kb(workbench.action.openGlobalKeybindings)`).

### Extended theme customisation syntax

The color customization settings allow users to customize colors of the current theme:

* `workbench.colorCustomizations`
* `editor.tokenColorCustomizations`
* `editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations`

There is new syntax to customize multiple themes at once:

```json
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "[Abyss][Red]": {
            "activityBar.background": "#ff0000"
        },
        "[Monokai*]": {
            "activityBar.background": "#ff0000"
        }
    },
```

Multiple themes can be listed as well as the `*` wildcard character can be used at the beginning and the end of the name.

### Settings Editor

The settings editor now supports validation on objects. The validation includes type errors that can be introduced when editing the JSON file directly.

![Object setting showing validation errors](images/1_59/obj-widget-validation.png)

Array settings now have drag and drop support, as long as none of the items are in edit mode:

![Drag and drop for the array settings](images/1_59/enum-array-dnd.gif)

Moreover, enum array settings now only show remaining options rather than all options.

### Extensions

Improved Extensions view on resize. In the following gif, you can see that the extensions view with default width shows all details (previously icon, ratings & install count were not shown). As it shrinks, smaller extension icon is shown and when its width reduces further, icon and ratings are hidden.

![Dynamic Extensions View](images/1_59/dynamic-extensions-view.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Light Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

Extensions view now shows a custom hover while hovering on an extension. This rich hover includes complete description of the extension and other useful information like why an extension is disabled or recommended.

![Custom Extension Hover](images/1_59/extension-hover.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Light Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

You can now see the runtime status of an extension like its activation time, whether it is activated on startup and if it has any warnings or errors generated in the newly introduced **Runtime Status** tab in the extensione editor. You can also see this information partly in the extension view and its hover (shown in the above picture).

![Extension Runtime Status](images/1_59/extension-runtime-status.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Light Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

Extension editor now shows categories, resources links and other information like extension release and update date in the **Details** tab. Clicking on a category will shows extensions with that category in the extensions view.

![Extension Details](images/1_59/extension-details.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Light Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

You can now install and manage extensions directly in the **Extension Pack** tab of the extension editor.

## Terminal

### Drag and drop terminals across windows

Drag terminals from the tabs list or editor area of one window into the tabs list, editor area, or panel of another window.

![](images/1_59/terminal-dnd.gif)

### Child process tracking and close warnings

The existing `terminal.integrated.confirmOnExit` and new `terminal.integrated.confirmOnKill` settings leverage child process tracking to warn when trying to close a terminal that has child processes under the shell process. By default this only affects terminals in the editor area but can be configured to show up more.

### Set contributed terminal profile as default

Terminal profiles contributed by extensions can now be set as the default profile.

![The terminal profile dropdown displays indicates the extension terminal profile is set as the default](images/1_59/extension-profile.png)

### Underline and strikethrough support

The terminal now supports underline and strikethrough attributes. For example [git can be configured](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-color) to use these new attributes:

![](images/1_59/terminal-styles.png)
*Theme: [Sapphire Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire)*

The above uses the following in `.gitconfig`:

```ini
[color "status"]
  added = green bold
  changed = red bold strike
  untracked = cyan
  branch = yellow black bold ul
```

### Create terminal in editor area to the side

The new command `workbench.action.createTerminalEditorSide` is available to create a terminal in the editor area to the side of the active editor.

### Active terminal tab indicator

Themes can now set a color to indicate the active terminal tabs using theme key `terminal.tab.activeBorder` which will fallback to `tab.activeBorder` when it's not set:

![](images/1_59/terminal-active.png)

### Disable animation in terminal tab icon

The new setting `terminal.integrated.tabs.enableAnimation` will disable animation in the terminal tab icon. For tasks instead of a spinner the play button will be used:

![](images/1_59/terminal-animation.png)

## Debugging

### Improved Run/Debug button in Editor Title

In the February release we had introduced a dropdown button to group the run and debug commands in a central (and compact) location in the editor's title area (see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_54#_limits-for-editor-title-menu-and-run-submenu)). Based on some user feedback we've tried to improve the dropdown button by remembering the last executed action. The dropdown button now has two click zones, one for the default action (left) and another for the dropdown (right) which, when selected runs the action and remembers it as the new default.

![debug/run splitbutton](images/1_59/run-debug-splitbutton.gif)

Please note:
- If there is only a single run or debug action, the dropdown menu is omitted.
- If there is more than one run or debug action, all actions appear in the dropdown menu and the default action is set to the first action from the dropdown menu (as long as there is no remembered action).
- The default action is preserved for a specific workspace across VS Code restarts; it is **not** preserved for the editor contents.

### Preview feature: Disassembly View

Thanks to a large [code contribution](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/125737) by the C++ team, we are happy to include a preview of a **Disassembly View** in this milestone.

The Disassembly view can be opened from an editor's context menu to show the disassembled source of the active stack frame, and it supports stepping through assembly instructions and setting breakpoints on individual instructions.

The Disassembly view is only available in an active debug session and when the underlying debug extension supports it.
As of today only the "C++" and "Mock Debug" extensions can feed the Disassembly view.

![disassembly view in mock debug](images/1_59/disassembly-view.gif)

From a technical perspective VS Code's implementation of the Disassembly view now supports four more features of the Debug Adapter Protocol:
- the `disassembly` request for providing the disassembled source for a mememory location,
- the `instructionPointerReference` property on stack frames,
- the `granularity` property on the stepping requests,
- instruction breakpoints and the `setInstructionBreakpoints` request.


## Contributions to extensions

### Live Preview

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

Work continues on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. This month's highlights:

- "Start working" on an issue has been expanded to let you work on issues outside of the repo you currently have open.

To learn about all the new features and updates, you can see the full [changelog for the 0.29.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0290) release of the extension.

## Preview Features

### TypeScript 4.4

This release includes support for the upcoming TypeScript 4.4 release. You can read more about the new language features and improvements in TypeScript 4.4 [on the TypeScript blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-4-beta/). Some tooling highlights:

- Inlay hints for parameter names and types in both JavaScript and TypeScript files.
- Basic spelling suggestions in plain JS files. These are only shown if we are confident in the error and in the fix.

To start using the TypeScript 4.4 nightly builds, install the [TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next).

Please share your feedback and let us know if you run into any bugs with TypeScript 4.4.

## Extension authoring

### Rich Status bar hover

Rich hovers including links and icons are now supported on Status bar items `StatusBarItem.tooltip: string | IMarkdownString`

![Rich Status bar hover](images/1_59/rich-statusbar-hover.png)

* If `MarkdownString.supportThemeIcons` is true, you can use icons with the `$(iconName)` syntax.
* If the `MarkdownString` is trusted, you can also add command links. Syntax: `([test](command:vscode.newWindow))`

### Status bar warning colors

Status bar items that represent warnings can use the newly added colors `statusBarItem.warningBackground` and `statusBarItem.warningForeground`.

<!-- In-product release notes styles.  Do not modify without also modifying regex in gulpfile.common.js -->
<a id="scroll-to-top" role="button" title="Scroll to top" aria-label="scroll to top" href="#"><span class="icon"></span></a>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/inproduct_releasenotes.css"/>

### Object settings without `additionalProperties`

Object settings without `additionalProperties` set to either `false` or an object will not be supported in the settings editor, due to the setting being able to take on any shape.

## Language Server Protocol

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Finalized "writeMemory" request and "memory" event proposal

The `writeMemory` request has been finalized and is now available in version 1.48 of the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) and the corresponding npm modules. If a debug adapter has a `supportsWriteMemoryRequest` capability clients can use the `writeMemory` request to write bytes to memory at a given location.

The `memory` event has a [proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/issues/194#issuecomment-886687894) that will be added to DAP in the next milestone.

## Proposed extension APIs

### `isDefault` for `TaskGroup`

The `group` property exists on tasks defined in a `tasks.json` file and is also exposed through the tasks API. The `group` property has an `isDefault` property, which until now has not been available in the API. This proposal exposes the `isDefault` property as readonly on the `TaskGroup`, so that extensions can read which task is a the default for a group, but cannot override a users configuration by setting the default for a group.

## Engineering

### iframe based webviews now used everywhere on Desktop

This month we finished our transition from [Electron's webview tag](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/webview-tag) element to normal `<iframe>` element based webviews. This better aligns the implementation of VS Code's webviews across desktop and web, and also let us delete a lot of now-redundant code.
