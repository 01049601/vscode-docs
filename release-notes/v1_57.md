<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.57 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/123368)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22May+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Removed `Cmd+W` / `Ctrl+W` as keybinding to close window when no editor is opened

We have gotten [feedback](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/54492) that users are frustrated when the window closes after having closed the last editor via keybindings. A quick poll in the team also revealed that many had the keybinding for closing a window unassigned, so we went ahead and removed `Cmd+W` / `Ctrl+W` as keybinding to close window when no editor is opened.

You can easily bring the keybinding back via the keybindings JSON editor:

```json
{
  "key": "cmd+w",
  "command": "workbench.action.closeWindow",
  "when": "!editorIsOpen && !multipleEditorGroups"
}
```

**Note:** on all platforms there is a dedicated assigned keybinding to close the window:
* macOS: `Cmd+Shift+W`
* Linux: `Alt+F4`
* Windows: `Alt+F4`

## Extension authoring

### New status bar item `id` and `name` properties

We finalized the API for `StatusBarItem` identifier and name properties. The identifier can be passed from the new overload of the `createStatusBarItem` method while the `name` property can change dynamically on the `StatusBarItem` itself.

These new properties are used for the context menu on the status bar to give individual entries a name and for allowing a user to show and hide entries. If you do not provide these properties, the menu will aggregate all status entries from one extension under a single entry.

If your extension contributes to the status bar, please consider updating to the new API.

## Engineering

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window ready for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation) features.

Specifically:

* We removed node.js dependencies from more code that is used in the renderer
* We continued investigating to drop `webview` usage entirely and switch to `iframe` for our custom views and editors

## Notable fixes

* [85332](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/85332): Windows: freeze on file delete
* [85332](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/108804): Do not wait for shell environment resolution before opening window
