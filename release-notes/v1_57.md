## Workbench

### Improved editor drag and drop across windows

Support for dragging editors to other windows was improved in this release. You can now drag diff editors, custom editors, and the entire editor group to another window to open the editors there.

### Removed Cmd+W / Ctrl+W keybinding to close window when no editor is opened

We have gotten [feedback](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/54492) that users are frustrated when the VS Code window (instance) suddenly closes after having closed the last editor via rapid `Cmd+W` / `Ctrl+W` usages. A quick poll in the team also revealed that many had the keybinding for closing a window unassigned, so we went ahead and removed `Cmd+W` / `Ctrl+W` as keybinding to close the window when no editor is opened.

You can easily bring the keybinding back by configuring it as follows:

**macOS**

```json
{
  "key": "cmd+w",
  "command": "workbench.action.closeWindow",
  "when": "!editorIsOpen && !multipleEditorGroups"
}
```

**Windows/Linux**

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+w",
  "command": "workbench.action.closeWindow",
  "when": "!editorIsOpen && !multipleEditorGroups"
}
```

**Note:** On all platforms, there is a dedicated assigned keybinding to close the window:

* macOS: `Cmd+Shift+W`
* Linux: `Alt+F4`
* Windows: `Alt+F4`

## Editor

### Suggestion Preview

With the new setting `editor.suggest.preview`, a preview of the selected suggestion or snippet can be enabled.

## Integrated Terminal

### Terminal tabs

Terminal tabs were introduced as a [preview feature in 1.56](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_56#_terminal-tabs) and are now enabled by default. The new tabs view will only show by default when there are at least two terminals. For single terminals, the tab is "inlined" into the panel title. This also introduces the concept of terminal statuses such as whether a task is running, succeeded or failed:

![](images/1_57/tabs-overview.png)

See below for some of the highlights new in this release:

- A tab's color can be changed to enable quick navigation and differentiation between them.
- Tabs can be dragged and dropped to allow for re-arranging.<br>![drag and drop](images/1_57/tabs-drag-and-drop.gif)
- Dragging a tab in a terminal group into the empty area will remove it from the group (ie. unsplit, also available via the context menu).<br>![unsplit](images/1_57/tabs-unsplit.gif)
- Dragging a tab into the main terminal area allows joining a group (also available via the context menu).<br>![joining](images/1_57/tabs-joining.gif)
- `kbstyle(alt)` now splits the terminal when clicking on a tab, the plus or the single tab, the same works for middle click for killing the terminal.<br>![split terminal buttons](images/1_57/tabs-split.gif)
- The inline actions won't be shown unless the tabs list is sufficiently large to avoid accidentally splitting/killing terminals
- When killing a terminal such that there will only be 1, the tabs list won't hide until the mouse leaves the view

If you're not a fan of the new UX you can go back to the dropdown by setting `"terminal.integrated.tabs.enabled": false`, the plan is to continue to support this as an option going forward.

### Terminal profile improvements

The terminal profile system has seen many improvements in this release, here are some highlights:

- `defaultProfile` will be respected if the terminal is restored upon launching VS Code and will be used for tasks and debugging.
- Intellisense now works in settings.json for `icon` and `defaultProfile`.
- `overrideName` now works for the default profile.
- `defaultProfile` can now be set in workspace settings, this is also now driven by the new trusted workspaces feature.
- If `defaultProfile` and `shell` or `shellArgs` settings are used, you will now be asked to migrate the deprecated settings to the profiles system.
- `color` can now be set on a profile.

### Title sequence support

The setting `terminal.integrated.experientalUseTitleEvent` setting has been promoted to stable as `terminal.integrated.titleMode`. By default this setting will be `executable` which names terminals based on the detected foreground process:

![Running git show will result in the terminal's title changing to git](images/1_57/terminal-title-executable.png)

When this is set to `sequence`, the title will be based on what the shell sets it to. This needs shell support to work, an example of this in action is oh-my-zsh's default prompt which shows additional information about the session:

![The oh-my-zsh default prompt will show the computer's name and current working directory](images/1_57/terminal-title-sequence.png)

### Improved launching with clean environment

The setting `terminal.integrated.inheritEnv` has been available since the [v1.39](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_36#_launch-terminals-with-clean-environments) but the implementation had some flaws where it could fail due to permissions issues on Linux and may not work as expected on macOS.

Due to improvements to how VS Code sets up its underlying environment it's now possible to access the initial environment it was launched with, which is how most terminals work. When `true` VS Code will now use the initial environment and when `false` use the sourced "shell environment". This setting can help the terminal act more like a regular terminal, you may run into problems depending on your profile/rc set up though if not set up correctly.

### Native line wrapping support on Windows

Line wrapping in the terminal drives task problem matchers and link detection. Historically the Windows terminal has used a heuristic to flag lines as wrapped since the emulation technology that simulates a Unix pty didn't support wrapping. This changes on recent versions of Windows, when updating to Windows 10 21376+ (currently Insiders only) this heuristic will be disabled and wrapped lines should work correctly as in Windows Terminal.

## Debugging

### Reveal hit breakpoint in the BREAKPOINTS view


When a breakpoint gets hit we now select and reveal it in the BREAKPOINTS view.
This should make it easier to understand which exact breakpoint has caused the program to break.

For now, the JS-debug extension has support for this, but we expect other debug extensions to follow soon.

![As the user steps in the program a breakpoint which got hit gets selected and revealed in the BREAKPOINTS view](images/1_57/reveal-breakpoint.gif)


## Extension authoring

### Notebook API

We have finalized the majority of the notebooks API. The API is structured into three separate parts:

1. The `NotebookSerializer`-API which, in combination with the `notebooks`-contribution point, enables VS Code to open, modify, and save notebook documents
1. Notebook renderers present cell output. They are added via the `notebookRenderer`-contribution point of your extensions `package.json`-file
1. The `NotebookController`-API which allows to generate ouput for code cells.


Sample of a simple notebook serializer and an echo controller. The serializer uses JSON.parse and stringify with special handling for empty files. The controller returns the upper-case variant of the cell text - once as plain text and once as html.

```ts
// serialize/deserialize notebook
vscode.workspace.registerNotebookSerializer(
  'echobook',
  new class implements vscode.NotebookSerializer {
    // serializer is relying on JSON.parse/stringify
    deserializeNotebook(content: Uint8Array) {
        return JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(content) || '{"cells":[]}');
    }
    serializeNotebook(data: vscode.NotebookData) {
        return new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(data));
    }
})

// notebook controller
vscode.notebooks.createNotebookController(
  'myId',
  'echobook',
  'Echo',
  (cells, _notebook, controller) => {
    for (let cell of cells) {
        // execution means to echo in upper-case, once as plain text and once as html
        const execution = controller.createNotebookCellExecution(cell);
        execution.start();
        const echo = cell.document.getText().toUpperCase();
        const textItem = vscode.NotebookCellOutputItem.text(echo, 'text/plain');
        const htmlItem = vscode.NotebookCellOutputItem.text(`<b>${echo}</b>`, 'text/html');
        const output = new vscode.NotebookCellOutput([textItem, htmlItem]);
        execution.replaceOutput(output)
        execution.end(true);
    }
});
```

Statically register the notebook type for `*.echobook`-files. Also, VS Code will emit an `onNotebook:echobook` activation events whenever such notebooks are being opened.

```json
"contributes": {
  "notebooks": [{
      "type": "echobook",
      "displayName": "Echobook",
      "selector": [{
        "filenamePattern": "*.echobook"
      }]
  }]
}
```

### New Status bar item id and name properties

We finalized the API for `StatusBarItem` identifier and name properties. The identifier can be passed from the new overload of the `createStatusBarItem` method while the `name` property can change dynamically on the `StatusBarItem` itself.

These new properties are used for the context menu on the status bar to give individual entries a name and for allowing a user to show and hide entries. If you do not provide these properties, the menu will aggregate all status entries from one extension under a single entry.

![Status bar item menu](images/1_57/status-menu.png)

If your extension contributes to the Status bar, please consider updating to the new API.

### Print a message in new terminals

When creating a terminal using `window.createTerminal` it's now possible to set a message via `TerminalOptions.message` that is printed at the top of the terminal. This supports ANSI escape sequences to enable text styles:

```ts
vscode.window.createTerminal({
	name: `My terminal`,
	message: '\x1b[3;1mSome custom message\x1b[0m'
});
```

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [vscode.proposed.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Enable file system providers to stat a file as readonly

File system providers can now mark individual files as readonly via a new `permissions` property on the `FileStat` by setting the value of the property to `FilePermission.Readonly`.

Readonly files are not editable.

**Note:** If all files should be treated readonly, you can use the existing `isReadonly` option when calling `registerFileSystemProvider`.

### Terminal profile contributions

This API will enable extensions to contribute to the terminal profile system. A few things need to happen to get this to work, first contribute the profile in the package.json:

```json
"contributes": {
	"terminal": {
		"profiles": [
			{
				"title": "Profile from extension",
				"id": "my-ext.terminal-profile",
				"icon": "lightbulb"
			}
		]
	},
}
```

Then activate the extension on the new `onTerminalProfile` activation event:

```json
"activationEvents": [
	"onTerminalProfile:my-ext.terminal-profile"
]
```

Lastly register the provider in the activation event:

```ts
vscode.window.registerTerminalProfileProvider('my-ext.terminal-profile', {
	provideProfileOptions(token) {
		return {
      name: 'Profile from extension',
      shellPath: 'cmd.exe'
    };
	}
});
```

Provided proposed API is enabled the profile should show up in the profiles list:

![](images/1_57/terminal-api-profile.png)

### iconPath support in terminal options

The standard iconPath type is supported on TerminalOptions and TerminalExtensionOptions to set the terminal's icon which shows up on its tab:

```ts
readonly iconPath?: Uri | { light: Uri; dark: Uri } | ThemeIcon;
```

### Change title of Pseudoterminal

The new event `Pseudoterminal.onDidChangeName` enabled control of Pseudoterminal-based terminals:

```ts
const writeEmitter = new EventEmitter<string>();
const nameEmitter = new EventEmitter<string>();
const pty = {
    onDidWrite: writeEmitter.event,
    open: () => writeEmitter.fire('Type to change the title of the terminal'),
    close: () => { /* noop*/ },
    handleInput: (data: string) => nameEmitter.fire(data)
};
const terminal = vscode.window.createTerminal({
    name: `My Terminal`,
    pty
});
terminal.show();
```

## Engineering

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window ready for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation) features.

Specifically:

* We removed node.js dependencies from more code that is used in the renderer
* We continued investigating to drop `webview` usage entirely and switch to `iframe` for our custom views and editors

## Notable fixes
