# January 2021 (version 1.53)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.53 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/112419)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22December%2FJanuary+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Tabs wrap

A new setting `workbench.editor.wrapTabs` is provided to let editor tabs wrap instead of showing a scrollbar.

*Theme: [GitHub Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

In case the available space for the tabs is too small, wrapping will temporarily turn off and you will see the old experience with a scrollbar.

**Note:** You can prevent wrapping tabs from growing very large by configuring `workbench.editor.tabSizing: shrink`.

### New setting `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromCodeNavigation`

A new setting `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromCodeNavigation` allows to explicitly enable preview editors from code navigation, such as "Go to Definition". In our previous release we changed the default to open editors normally from code navigation and this setting allows to change this back to how it used to be.

### Emmet Performance and Feature Improvements

Emmet now works much faster in large HTML and CSS files. Also, the extension now uses the latest Emmet dependency, meaning that features such as countdowns are now supported.

## Integrated Terminal

## Debugging

### JavaScript Debugger

A complete list of changes can be found in the [js-debug changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

**Conditional Exception Breakpoints**

[Conditional exception breakpoints](./v1_52#_support-for-conditional-exceptions) are now supported in the JavaScript debugger. The `error` variable will contain the currently-thrown exception:

![Screencapture that shows checking 'pause on caught exceptions' and entering 'err.message.includes("my error") as the condition. A thrown exception that doesn't match this condition is skipped, and the debugger than pauses on the exception that does.](images/1_53/js-debug-conditional-exceptions.gif)

**Debug worker_threads**

Debugging of Node.js `worker_threads` is now supported.

No changes or extra configuration is needed.

### Remote layout persistence

Terminal layout is restored on remote terminal reconnection. In the video below, the terminal layout is restored when reloading VS Code and reconnecting to a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) remote instance.

## Extension authoring

### Status bar entry background color API

The previously proposed `backgroundColor` for  `StatusBarItem` API is now stable. Currently only `statusBarItem.errorBackground` is supported to avoid the Status bar looking too colorful. We may expand this support to more colors in the future.

![Status bar error in red](images/1_52/status-error.png)

The use case for this new API is to enable extensions to indicate error conditions in the Status bar. For example, the ESLint extension may decide to use this color to alert the user that ESLint has not yet been enabled for a workspace.

### Adding `CancellationError`-type

We have added a new error type: `vscode.CancellationError`. This type can be used in response to a `CancellationToken` being cancelled or when an operation is being cancelled by the executor of that operation.


## Engineering

### Progress on Electron Sandbox

This milestone we continued to make the VSCode window fit for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation).

**Specifically:**
* the IPC connection to our background shared process changed from a node.js socket connection to using Electron's [`MessagPort`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/message-port-main) API
* there is a new internal option to enable the experimental `vscode-file` protocol for the main window that enables us to do some selfhosting (the issue reporter and process explorer already run with this option since last milestone)
* we removed more direct node.js API that is used in the VSCode window

### VS Code is now Trusted Types compliant

We have finished the work on making VS Code trusted types compliant: https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-trusted-types

## Notable fixes

* [96409](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/96409): Trackpad: Tab switch on mouse scroll: horizontal scrolling sensitivity too high
