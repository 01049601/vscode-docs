# January 2021 (version 1.53)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.53 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/112419)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22December%2FJanuary+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Wrap tabs

A new setting `workbench.editor.wrapTabs` is provided to let editor tabs wrap instead of showing a scrollbar.

![Wrapping Tabs](images/1_53/tabs-wrap.gif)
*Theme: [GitHub Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

In case the available space for the tabs is too small, wrapping will temporarily turn off and you will see the old experience with a scrollbar.

**Note:** You can prevent wrapping tabs from growing very large by configuring `workbench.editor.tabSizing: shrink`.

### Tab decorations

Two new settings allow you to configure whether editor tabs show decorations, such as git status or diagnostics. Use `workbench.editor.decorations.colors` to decorate tabs with colors, like red/green for files with errors and warnings, and use `workbench.editor.decorations.badges` to decorate tabs with badges, like `M` for git modified.

![Editor Tab with decorations](images/1_53/tabs-deco.png)
*Theme: [GitHub Light Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

### Open Editors view hidden by default

The Open Editors view is now hidden by default. This will only affect new VS Code users, existing users will still see the Open Editors view as before. The reason for this change is that we wanted to present a cleaner look in the Explorer view out-of-the-box, and we believe that the functionality that the Open Editors view brings is covered in other areas of the workbench, like tabs.
The visibility of the Open Editors view can easily be controlled by the context menu in the Explorer view title area.

![Open Editors menu](images/1_53/open-editors.png)

### New confirmation dialogs

If a user tries to quit VS Code while there is a file operation in progress, we now show a confirmation dialog. We also show a confirmation dialog for destructive undo operations from the Explorer.

We always want to avoid data loss, so we've introduced these dialogs to make sure it doesn't happen by accident.

![Destructive undo operation confirmation](images/1_53/destructive-undo.png)

### New setting `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromCodeNavigation`

A new setting `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromCodeNavigation` allows you to explicitly enable preview editors from code navigations, such as "Go to Definition". In our previous release, we changed the default to open editors normally from code navigation. This setting allows you to change this back to how it used to be, if you prefer.

### Emmet performance and feature improvements

Emmet now works much faster in large HTML and CSS files. Also, the extension now uses the latest Emmet dependency, meaning that features such as countdowns are now supported.

![An example of Emmet expanding with a countdown in a large HTML file.](images/1_53/emmet-large-html-example.gif)

### Improved refactor participants UI

Extension can participant when you create, move, rename, or delete files. This is useful to automatically run refactorings, e.g. when renaming a Java file you also need to rename its public class.

![Refactor Participant Preview](images/1_53/refactor-preview.png)

There is now unified UI for these participants which allows you to accept, skip, and preview additional changes an extension is making.

### Open with with supports alternative opening mode

After running the `Reopen Editor With` command, you can now hold down `ctrl` when selecting the editor to use to open the new editor to the side of the current editor. This matches the behavior of VS Code's quick open.

Additionally, pressing right arrow in the `Reopen Editor With` dialog will now open the editor in the background.

## Editor

### New snippet variables

There are new snippet variables for inserting UUIDs, and for inserting the relative path of the current file. The sample snippet below would print:

`let someId = 'foo/test.js/c13d226f-1932-40e2-9fd9-10198c219e33'`

```json
// sample snippet using UUID and RELATIVE_FILEPATH
{
  "scope": "javascript",
  "prefix": "newVars",
  "body": "let someId = '${RELATIVE_FILEPATH}/${UUID}'$0"
}
```

### Transform to snake case

There is a new command **Transform to Snake Case** that will convert the selected text to snake case (e.g. `myVariable` -> `my_variable`).

## Terminal

### Flow control

The connection between the terminal processes and the frontend is now protected by a flow control mechanism that will pause the process when the frontend needs to catch up. Previously, this would cause stability/performance issues when using a terminal in a remote connection. This change only applies when using VS Code's remoting functionality for now, but it will be used for local windows soon, after we tweak where terminal processes get launched.

### Better PowerShell 7 discovery

[PowerShell 7](http://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) is the latest and greatest version of PowerShell which can be installed on Windows, macOS and Linux. If you install PowerShell 7 on Windows, VS Code will use that as the default shell. If you don't have PowerShell 7 installed, VS Code will continue to use Windows PowerShell as the default.

Additionally, if you open the "Select Default Shell" quick pick, the enumeration of all of the installed PowerShell versions will show up (MSI installation, Microsoft Store installation, etc.).

![Select Default Shell showing possible PowerShell options](images/1_53/choose-default-shell.png)

> NOTE: macOS and Linux default shell discovery and shell enumeration are uneffected by this because they use the default set by the OS and /etc/shells respectively.
> Additionally, the `terminal.integrated.shell.windows` setting is still honored.

## Notebooks

### Outline and breadcrumbs

Notebook cells now show up in the outline pane and breadcrumbs. This allows for a better overview and fast navigation within notebooks.

![Notebook with outline and breadcrumbs](images/1_53/notebook-outline.png)

There are two settings that allow you to define if code cells are part of the outline or not.

* `notebook.outline.showCodeCells`: Whether outline contains code cells.
* `notebook.breadcrumbs.showCodeCells`: Whether breadcrumbs contain code cells.

### Notebook diff editor: rich output rendering and performance improvement

The diff editor for notebook documents now support rendering rich outputs like tables, images or html outputs.

![Notebook rich diff](images/1_53/notebook-rich-diff.png)

This feature is currently available in [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders) and you can install either [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) or [.NET Interactive](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) extension to preview.

We also improved the scrolling performance to ensure a smooth experience while browsing changes in the diff editor.

## Debugging

**Start the same debug configuration multiple times**

Now it is possible to start multiple debug sessions from the same launch configuration. You can select the configuration that you want to use and start debugging any number of times you would like.
Each subsequent debug session will have a number appended at the end of the name so they can be distinguished.

![Multiple debug sessions](images/1_53/multiple-sessions.png)


**Breakpoints: condition editing**

It is now possible to edit conditions for exception breakpoints and function breakpoints using the inline **Edit Condition** action or the new context menu actions.

Using conditions, it is possible for the user to specify that the program should break on an exception only when a particular condition is met.
Currently the Javascript debug extension supports conditions for exceptions or function breakpoints, and soon other debug extensions will support it as well.

![Breakpoint zone widget colored](images/1_53/breakpoints.gif)


**Prompt to save untitled files before run/debug**

We now prompt you to save open untitled files in the active editor group before running or debugging.

A common issue reported from new users who are just getting into coding is forgetting to save files before running them, so we wanted to make it easier for new users to just be able to run their files. A file has to be saved on disk since most of the debug extensions can not debug open untitled files (PowerShell being the exception).

**Syntax coloring for breakpoint zone widget**

The breakpoint editor zone widget now supports syntax coloring by respecting the language mode of the underlying editor.

![Breakpoint zone widget colored](images/1_53/breakpoint-widget.png)


**Debug console icon moved into secondary menu**

We are moving the Debug Console action from the top of the debug view to the `...` secondary menu. We believe that it fits better in this new location with other views and that the button is not very useful while you are not debugging - and when you are debugging the debug console opens automatically. Another motivation for this change is to save horizontal space in the title area.

![Debug console menu](images/1_53/debug-console.png)


**Improved logging for extension debugging**

Calls to `console` APIs when debugging extensions are now processed through the JavaScript debugger. This allows for richer representation of complex objects and features such as sourcemapped stracktraces.

### JavaScript Debugger

A complete list of changes can be found in the [js-debug changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

**Conditional Exception Breakpoints**

[Conditional exception breakpoints](./v1_52#_support-for-conditional-exceptions) are now supported in the JavaScript debugger. The `error` variable will contain the currently-thrown exception:

![Screencapture that shows checking 'pause on caught exceptions' and entering 'err.message.includes("my error") as the condition. A thrown exception that doesn't match this condition is skipped, and the debugger than pauses on the exception that does.](images/1_53/js-debug-conditional-exceptions.gif)
*Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong)*

**Debug worker_threads**

Debugging of Node.js `worker_threads` is now supported.

![Screenshot of the debugger paused inside a Node.js worker_thread script](images/1_53/js-debug-worker-thread.png)
*Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong)*

No changes or extra configuration is needed.

## Integrated Terminal
### Remote layout persistence

Terminal layout is restored on remote terminal reconnection. As shown below, the terminal layout is restored when reloading VS Code and reconnecting to a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) remote instance.

![In a remote window, three split terminals are created and resized. On reload, the layout appears unchanged.](images/1_53/terminal-splits-persist.gif)

## Issue Reporting

If you're signed in with GitHub, you can now directly create issues from the issue reporter.

## Languages

### Markdown preview auto updates when images are changed on disk

The markdown preview will now automatically update when any images it contains are changed on disk:

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

This can happen when you edit the image file using an external program or when from a source control operation, such as switching branches.

## Preview Features

### TypeScript 4.2 Support

This release continues to improve our support for the upcoming TypeScript 4.2 release. You can read more about the new language features and improvements in TypeScript 4.2 [on the TypeScript blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-2-beta/). Here are some of the editor improvements it enables:

- JS Doc templates now generate `@returns`.
- Deprecated DOM apis are now marked as such.
- A quick fix to declare missing functions.
- Native support for semantic highlighting, instead of using a TypeScript service plugin.

To start using the TypeScript 4.2 nightly builds, just install the [TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next). Please share feedback and let us know if you run into any bugs with TypeScript 4.2.

### Find References to File

If you are using TypeScript 4.2, you can also try the new `Find References to File` command for JavaScript and TypeScript to find all places where a file is being referenced.

![Finding all references to a file](images/1_53/ts-file-references.png)

You can trigger this command in a few different ways:

- For the active file using `TypeScript: Find File References` command.
- Right click on an editor tab and select: `Find File References`
- Right click on a file in the explorer and select: `Find File References`

## Extension authoring

### Status bar entry background color API

The previously proposed `backgroundColor` for the `StatusBarItem` API is now stable. Currently only `statusBarItem.errorBackground` is supported to avoid the Status bar looking too colorful. We may expand this support to more colors in the future.

![Status bar error in red](images/1_52/status-error.png)

The use case for this new API is to enable extensions to indicate error conditions in the Status bar. For example, the ESLint extension may decide to use this color to alert the user that ESLint has not yet been enabled for a workspace.

### Adding `CancellationError`-type

We have added a new error type: `vscode.CancellationError`. This type can be used in response to a `CancellationToken` being cancelled or when an operation is being cancelled by the executor of that operation.

### `OnEnterRule.previousLineText`

It is now possible to target the text on the previous line when evaluating an `OnEnterRule` using the newly added property `previousLineText`.

### `onEnterRules` in language configuration files

Until now, `onEnterRules` could be defined only using the `vscode.languages.setLanguageConfiguration` API. Now, `onEnterRules` can also be defined in the language configuration file. e.g.:

```json
  "onEnterRules": [
    {
      "beforeText": "^\\s*(?:def|class|for|if|elif|else|while|try|with|finally|except|async).*?:\\s*$",
      "action": { "indent": "indent" }
    }
  ]
```

### Semantic token commands

There are now new commands to invoke the semantic tokens provider. The commands are:

* `vscode.provideDocumentSemanticTokensLegend` with an argument of type `Uri`
* `vscode.provideDocumentSemanticTokens` with an argument of type `Uri`
* `vscode.provideDocumentRangeSemanticTokensLegend` with an argument of type `Uri`
* `vscode.provideDocumentRangeSemanticTokens` with two arguments: the first an `Uri` and the second a `Range`.

### Secrets

Similar to the storage API, there is now an API for storing and retrieving secrets on a per-extension basis. This allows extensions to store sensitive information in the OS credential manager or keystore.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Inline value provider API

Today the "Show Inline Values" feature of VS Code's debugger is based on a generic implementation in VS Code core and provides neither customizability through settings, nor extensibility via extensions. As a consequence, it is not a perfect fit for all languages and sometimes shows incorrect values because it doesn't understand the underlying source language. For this reason we are working on an extension API that allows to replace the built-in implementation completely or to replace parts of the implementation with custom code.

In this milestone we have created an [initial proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/105690). If you are interested in this extension API, we'd appreciate your feedback.

### Testing

We are investigating [testing in VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/107467), and the first version of the API is now present in `vscode.proposed.d.ts`. Please read the linked issue for additional context, and participate if you have input to give.

This iteration focused building out the "Selfhost Test Provider" for VS Code and foundational UI, primarily the test explorer, gutter decorations, and peek views for results.

![Screenshot of a failed test with a diff peek view open showing the difference between actual and expected values.](images/1_53/testing.png)
*Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong)*

### External URI Opener

The proposed external URI opener api allows extensions to handle opening http and https links that the user clicks on in the editor. For example, a browser preview extension could use this to open links to a local server in VS Code directly, instead of opening the link with the user's default browser:

To use the external opener API, first add an `onUriOpen` activation event for the url schemes your opener supports. Currently only `http` and `https` urls are supported:

```json
"activationEvents": [
  "onUriOpen:http",
  "onUriOpen:https"
]
```

Then in your extension's activation, call `registerExternalUriOpener` to register your external uri opener:

```ts
vscode.window.registerExternalUriOpener('myExtension.opener', {
  canOpenExternalUri(uri: vscode.Uri) {
    // Check if a uri can be opened.
    // This is called when the user first clicks on a link and VS Code
    // needs to determine which openers are available.

    if (uri.authority === 'localhost:8080') {
      // This opener has default priority for this uri.
      // This will result in the user being prompted since VS Code always has
      // its own default opener.
      return vscode.ExternalUriOpenerPriority.Default;
    }

    // The opener can be used but should not be used by default
    return vscode.ExternalUriOpenerPriority.Option;
  },
  openExternalUri(resolveUri: vscode.Uri) {
    // Actually open the uri.
    // This is called once the user has selected this opener.
  }
}, {
  schemes: ['http', 'https'],
  label: localize('openTitle', "Open url using My Extension"),
});
```

Now when you click links to `localhost:8080` in the editor or terminal, you will be prompted to select how the url should be opened:

![Selecting the opener for a URI](images/1_53/external-opener-prompt.png)

Additionally, you can configure a default opener for a uri using the new `workbench.externalUriOpeners` setting:

```json
"workbench.externalUriOpeners": {
  "localhost:8081": "myExtension.opener"
}
```

## Language Server Protocol and Language Server Index Format

Work has started on the [3.17](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-17) version of the protocol. The first proposed feature is support for a more detailed completion item label.

We also improved the LSIF indexer for TypeScript and tested it against a broader range of open source repositories. Major improvements are:

* A tolerant index mode which uses more memory but doesn't fail if a symbol's moniker is not correctly computed (see `--moniker` command line option).
* Log file support to help find situations where monikers can't be correctly computed.
* A new LSIF dump validation tool (lsif-tooling). The tools can be used with dumps produced by any tool. It is not constraint to the TypeScript indexer. The tool checks and LSIF dump for:
  * Correct vertex and edge layout (e.g. correct properties and types of the properties)
  * That vertices are emitted before the are referenced in edges
  * The cardinality of edges
  * The outgoing and incoming type of a edges.
  * That the dump is portioned correctly (e.g. no result partitions are added to documents / projects that are already closed)

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Value `dataBreakpoint` from `VariablePresentationHint.kind` is deprecated

Currently, we can detect whether an object has a data breakpoint by checking for the `dataBreakpoint` kind from `VariablePresentationHint`. However, the variable `kind` is generally used to identify the actual type of the object - that is, if it's an interface, a method or a derived class. Data breakpoint tracking, which is generally used for UI purposes, should be declared as an `attribute` instead, since that can be set alongside other attributes and variable kinds.

Consequently we have deprecated the value `dataBreakpoint` from the `kind` property of the `VariablePresentationHint` and added a new value `hasDataBreakpoint` for the `attribute` property of the `VariablePresentationHint`.

## Engineering

### Progress on Electron Sandbox

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window fit for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation).

**Specifically:**
* The IPC connection to our background shared process changed from a node.js socket connection to using Electron's [`MessagPort`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/message-port-main) API.
* There is a new internal option to enable the experimental `vscode-file` protocol for the main window that enables us to do some selfhosting (the issue reporter and process explorer already run with this option since last milestone).
* We removed the more direct Node.js API that is used in the VSCode window.

### VS Code is now Trusted Types compliant

We have finished the work to make VS Code trusted types compliant: https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-trusted-types
