# January 2021 (version 1.53)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.53 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/112419)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22December%2FJanuary+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Tabs wrap

A new setting `workbench.editor.wrapTabs` is provided to let editor tabs wrap instead of showing a scrollbar.

*Theme: [GitHub Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

In case the available space for the tabs is too small, wrapping will temporarily turn off and you will see the old experience with a scrollbar.

**Note:** You can prevent wrapping tabs from growing very large by configuring `workbench.editor.tabSizing: shrink`.

### Tab Decorations

Two new settings allow to configure wether editor tabs show decorations, such as git status or diagnostics. Use `workbench.editor.decorations.colors` to decorate tabs with colors, like red/green for files with error and warning, and use `workbench.editor.decorations.badges` to decorate tabs with badges, like `M` for git modified.

### New setting `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromCodeNavigation`

A new setting `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromCodeNavigation` allows to explicitly enable preview editors from code navigation, such as "Go to Definition". In our previous release we changed the default to open editors normally from code navigation and this setting allows to change this back to how it used to be.

### Emmet Performance and Feature Improvements

Emmet now works much faster in large HTML and CSS files. Also, the extension now uses the latest Emmet dependency, meaning that features such as countdowns are now supported.

### Improved Refactor Participants UI

Extension can participant when use create, move, rename, or delete files. This is useful to automatically run refactorings, e.g. when renaming a Java file you also need to rename its public class.

![Refactor Participant Preview](images/1_53/refactor-preview.png)

There is now unified UI for these participants which allows you to accept, skip, and preview additional changes an extension is making.

## Editor

### New Snippet Variables

There are new snippet variables for inserting uuids and for inserting the relative path the current file. The sample snippet below would print:

`let someId = 'foo/test.js/c13d226f-1932-40e2-9fd9-10198c219e33'`

```json
// sample snippet using UUID and RELATIVE_FILEPATH
{
  "scope": "javascript",
  "prefix": "newVars",
  "body": "let someId = '${RELATIVE_FILEPATH}/${UUID}'$0"
}
```

## Notebooks

### Outline and Breadcrumbs

Notebook cells now show up in the outline pane and breadcrumbs. This allows for a better overview and fast navigation within notebooks.

![Notebook with outline and breadcrumbs](images/1_53/notebook-outline.png)

There are two settings that allow to define if code cells are part of the outline or not.

* `notebook.outline.showCodeCells` Wether outline contains code cells.
* `notebook.breadcrumbs.showCodeCells` Wether breadcrumbs contains code cells.

## Debugging

### JavaScript Debugger

A complete list of changes can be found in the [js-debug changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

**Conditional Exception Breakpoints**

[Conditional exception breakpoints](./v1_52#_support-for-conditional-exceptions) are now supported in the JavaScript debugger. The `error` variable will contain the currently-thrown exception:

![Screencapture that shows checking 'pause on caught exceptions' and entering 'err.message.includes("my error") as the condition. A thrown exception that doesn't match this condition is skipped, and the debugger than pauses on the exception that does.](images/1_53/js-debug-conditional-exceptions.gif)
*Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong)*

**Debug worker_threads**

Debugging of Node.js `worker_threads` is now supported.

*Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong)*

No changes or extra configuration is needed.

## Integrated Terminal
### Remote layout persistence

Terminal layout is restored on remote terminal reconnection. As shown below, the terminal layout is restored when reloading VS Code and reconnecting to a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) remote instance.

![In a remote window, three split terminals are created and resized. On reload, the layout appears unchanged.](images/1_53/terminal-splits-persist.gif)

## Extension authoring

### Status bar entry background color API

The previously proposed `backgroundColor` for  `StatusBarItem` API is now stable. Currently only `statusBarItem.errorBackground` is supported to avoid the Status bar looking too colorful. We may expand this support to more colors in the future.

![Status bar error in red](images/1_52/status-error.png)

The use case for this new API is to enable extensions to indicate error conditions in the Status bar. For example, the ESLint extension may decide to use this color to alert the user that ESLint has not yet been enabled for a workspace.

### Adding `CancellationError`-type

We have added a new error type: `vscode.CancellationError`. This type can be used in response to a `CancellationToken` being cancelled or when an operation is being cancelled by the executor of that operation.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Inline Value Provider API

Today the "Show Inline Values" feature of VS Code's debugger is based on a generic implementation in VS Code core and provides neither customizability through settings, nor extensibility via extensions. As a consequence, it is not a perfect fit for all languages and sometimes shows incorrect values because it doesn't understand the underlying source language. For this reason we are working on an extension API that allows to replace the built-in implementation completely or to replace parts of the implementation with custom code.

In this milestone we have created an [initial proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/105690). If you are interested in this extension API, we'd appreciate your feedback.

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Value `dataBreakpoint` from `VariablePresentationHint.kind` is deprecated

Currently, we can detect whether an object has a data breakpoint by checking for the `dataBreakpoint` kind from `VariablePresentationHint`. However, the variable `kind` is generally used to identify the actual type of the object -- that is, if it's an interface, a method or a derived class. Data breakpoint tracking, which is generally used for UI purposes, should be declared as an `attribute` instead, since that can be set alongside other attributes and variable kinds.

Consequently we have deprecated the value `dataBreakpoint` from the `kind` property of the `VariablePresentationHint` and added a new value `hasDataBreakpoint` for the `attribute` property of the `VariablePresentationHint`.

## Engineering

### Progress on Electron Sandbox

This milestone we continued to make the VSCode window fit for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation).

**Specifically:**
* the IPC connection to our background shared process changed from a node.js socket connection to using Electron's [`MessagPort`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/message-port-main) API
* there is a new internal option to enable the experimental `vscode-file` protocol for the main window that enables us to do some selfhosting (the issue reporter and process explorer already run with this option since last milestone)
* we removed more direct node.js API that is used in the VSCode window

### VS Code is now Trusted Types compliant

We have finished the work on making VS Code trusted types compliant: https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-trusted-types

## Notable fixes

* [96409](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/96409): Trackpad: Tab switch on mouse scroll: horizontal scrolling sensitivity too high
