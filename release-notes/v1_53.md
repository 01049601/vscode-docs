# January 2021 (version 1.53)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.53 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/112419)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22December%2FJanuary+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Wrap tabs

A new setting `workbench.editor.wrapTabs` is provided to let editor tabs wrap instead of showing a scrollbar.

![Wrapping Tabs](images/1_53/tabs-wrap.gif)
*Theme: [GitHub Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

In case the available space for the tabs is too small, wrapping will temporarily turn off and you will see the old experience with a scrollbar.

**Note:** You can prevent wrapping tabs from growing very large by configuring `workbench.editor.tabSizing: shrink`.

### Tab decorations

Two new settings allow you to configure whether editor tabs show decorations, such as git status or diagnostics. Use `workbench.editor.decorations.colors` to decorate tabs with colors, like red/green for files with errors and warnings, and use `workbench.editor.decorations.badges` to decorate tabs with badges, like `M` for git modified.

![Editor Tab with decorations](images/1_53/tabs-deco.png)
*Theme: [GitHub Light Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

### Open Editors view hidden by default

The Open Editors view is now hidden by default. This will only affect new VS Code users, existing users will still see the Open Editors view as before. The reason for this change is that we wanted to present a cleaner look in the Explorer view out-of-the-box, and we believe that the functionality that the Open Editors view brings is covered in other areas of the workbench, like tabs.
The visibility of the Open Editors view can easily be controlled by the context menu in the Explorer view title area.

![Open Editors menu](images/1_53/open-editors.png)

### New confirmation dialogs

If a user tries to quit VS Code while there is a file operation in progress, we now show a confirmation dialog. We also show a confirmation dialog for destructive undo operations from the Explorer.

We always want to avoid data loss, so we've introduced these dialogs to make sure it doesn't happen by accident.

![Destructive undo operation confirmation](images/1_53/destructive-undo.png)

### New setting workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromCodeNavigation

A new setting `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromCodeNavigation` allows you to explicitly enable preview editors from code navigations, such as **Go to Definition**. In our previous release, we changed the default to open editors normally from code navigation. This setting allows you to change this back to how it used to be, if you prefer.

### Emmet performance and feature improvements

Emmet now works much faster in large HTML and CSS files. Also, the extension now uses the latest Emmet dependency, meaning that features such as countdowns are now supported.

![An example of Emmet expanding with a countdown in a large HTML file.](images/1_53/emmet-large-html-example.gif)

### Improved refactor participants UI

Extensions can participate when you create, move, rename, or delete files. This is useful when automatically running refactorings, for example, when you rename a Java file and also need to rename its public class.

![Refactor Participant Preview](images/1_53/refactor-preview.png)

There is now unified UI for these participants, which allows you to accept, skip, and preview the other changes that an extension is making.

### Open with supports alternative opening mode

After running the **Reopen Editor With** command, you can now hold down `Ctrl` when selecting the editor to use to open the new editor to the side of the current editor. This matches the behavior of VS Code's quick open.

Additionally, pressing right arrow in the **Reopen Editor With** dialog will now open the editor in the background.

### Issue reporting

If you're signed in with GitHub, you can now directly create issues from the issue reporter (**Help** > **Report Issue**).

### Default search mode

The `search.mode` setting is now available to allow configuring what search UI commands like **Search: Find in Files**, and the explorer's **Find in Folder...** and **Find in Workspace** context menu entries use, with options of:

* `view`: Default existing behavior, search using the search view in the sidebar or panel
* `newEditor`: Search in a new Search Editor
* `existingEditor`: Reusing an existing open Search Editor if one exists, otherwise create a new one

In the past, it was advised to configure default search UI by editing keybindings. This is no longer necessary, and these keybindings can be removed in favor of this setting.

![Recording of the different search mode options](images/1_53/SearchMode.gif)

### New file and folder icons

We've updated our icons for new file and folder to make them consistent with our other iconography:

![New file and folder icons](images/1_53/new-folder-file-icons.png)

## Editor

### New snippet variables

There are new snippet variables for inserting UUIDs, and for inserting the relative path of the current file. The sample snippet below would print:

`let someId = 'foo/test.js/c13d226f-1932-40e2-9fd9-10198c219e33'`

```json
// sample snippet using UUID and RELATIVE_FILEPATH
{
  "scope": "javascript",
  "prefix": "newVars",
  "body": "let someId = '${RELATIVE_FILEPATH}/${UUID}'$0"
}
```

### Transform to snake case

There is a new command **Transform to Snake Case** that will convert the selected text to snake case (for example, `myVariable` -> `my_variable`).

## Debugging

**Start the same debug configuration multiple times**

Now it is possible to start multiple debug sessions from the same launch configuration. You can select the configuration that you want to use and start debugging any number of times you would like.
Each subsequent debug session will have a number appended at the end of the name so they can be distinguished.

![Multiple debug sessions](images/1_53/multiple-sessions.png)

**Breakpoints: condition editing**

It is now possible to edit conditions for exception breakpoints and function breakpoints using the inline **Edit Condition** action or the new context menu actions.

Using conditions, it is possible for the user to specify that the program should break on an exception only when a particular condition is met.
Currently the JavaScript debug extension supports conditions for exceptions or function breakpoints, and soon other debug extensions will support it as well.

![Breakpoint zone widget colored](images/1_53/breakpoints.gif)

**Prompt to save untitled files before run/debug**

We now prompt you to save open untitled files in the active editor group before running or debugging.

A common issue reported from new users who are just getting into coding is forgetting to save files before running them, so we wanted to make it easier for new users to just be able to run their files. A file has to be saved on disk since most of the debug extensions cannot debug open untitled files (PowerShell being the exception).

**Syntax coloring for breakpoint zone widget**

The breakpoint editor zone widget now supports syntax coloring by respecting the language mode of the underlying editor.

![Breakpoint zone widget colored](images/1_53/breakpoint-widget.png)

**Debug console icon moved into secondary menu**

We are moving the Debug Console action from the top of the debug view to the `...` secondary menu. We believe that it fits better in this new location with other views and that the button is not very useful while you are not debugging - and when you are debugging the debug console opens automatically. Another motivation for this change is to save horizontal space in the title area.

![Debug console menu](images/1_53/debug-console.png)

**Improved logging for extension debugging**

Calls to `console` APIs when debugging extensions are now processed through the JavaScript debugger. This allows for richer representation of complex objects and features such as source mapped stacktraces.

### JavaScript debugger

A complete list of changes can be found in the [js-debug changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

**Conditional exception breakpoints**

[Conditional exception breakpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52#_support-for-conditional-exceptions) are now supported in the JavaScript debugger. The `error` variable will contain the currently thrown exception:

![Screencapture that shows checking 'pause on caught exceptions' and entering 'err.message.includes("my error") as the condition. A thrown exception that doesn't match this condition is skipped, and the debugger than pauses on the exception that does.](images/1_53/js-debug-conditional-exceptions.gif)
*Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong)*

**Debug worker_threads**

Debugging of Node.js `worker_threads` is now supported.

![Screenshot of the debugger paused inside a Node.js worker_thread script](images/1_53/js-debug-worker-thread.png)
*Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong)*

No changes or extra configuration is needed.

## Integrated Terminal

### Remote layout persistence

Terminal layout is restored on remote terminal reconnection. As shown below, the terminal layout is restored when reloading VS Code and reconnecting to a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) remote instance.

![In a remote window, three split terminals are created and resized. On reload, the layout appears unchanged.](images/1_53/terminal-splits-persist.gif)

### Flow control

The connection between the terminal processes and the frontend is now protected by a flow control mechanism that will pause the process when the frontend needs to catch up. Previously, this would cause stability/performance issues when using a terminal in a remote connection. This change only applies when using VS Code's remoting functionality for now, but it will be used for local windows soon, after we tweak where terminal processes get launched.

### Better PowerShell 7 discovery

[PowerShell 7](http://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) is the latest and greatest version of PowerShell, which can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux. If you install PowerShell 7 on Windows, VS Code will use that as the default shell. If you don't have PowerShell 7 installed, VS Code will continue to use Windows PowerShell as the default.

Additionally, if you open the **Select Default Shell** Quick Pick, the enumeration of all of the installed PowerShell versions will show up (MSI installation, Microsoft Store installation, etc.).

![Select Default Shell showing possible PowerShell options](images/1_53/choose-default-shell.png)

> **Note**: macOS and Linux default shell discovery and shell enumeration are uneffected by this because they use the default set by the OS and /etc/shells respectively.
> Additionally, the `terminal.integrated.shell.windows` setting is still honored.

## Languages

### Markdown preview auto updates when images are changed on disk

The Markdown preview will now automatically update when any embedded images are changed on disk:

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

This can happen when you edit the image file using an external program or from a source control operation, such as switching branches.

## Notebooks

### Outline and breadcrumbs

Notebook cells now show up in the outline pane and breadcrumbs. This allows for a better overview and fast navigation within notebooks.

![Notebook with outline and breadcrumbs](images/1_53/notebook-outline.png)

There are two settings that allow you to define if code cells are part of the outline or not.

* `notebook.outline.showCodeCells`: Whether outline contains code cells
* `notebook.breadcrumbs.showCodeCells`: Whether breadcrumbs contain code cells

### Notebook diff editor: rich output rendering and performance improvement

The diff editor for notebook documents now supports rendering rich output like tables, images, or HTML output.

![Notebook rich diff](images/1_53/notebook-rich-diff.png)

This feature is currently available in [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders) and you can install either [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) or [.NET Interactive](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) extension to preview.

We also improved the scrolling performance to ensure a smooth experience while browsing changes in the diff editor.

### Add new cell toolbar

We've updated our add new cell toolbar to appear whenever you hover over a cell to make it more discoverable.

![Add new cell toolbar](images/1_53/add-new-cell.gif)

## Source Control

### Git: New command

A new Git command has been added to the Command Palette:

* **Git: Open All Changes...** - Opens all modified and untracked files.

### Git: Warning when pulling (or sync'ing) and the current branch has been rebased

VS Code will now warn you whenever you attempt to pull (or sync) and the current branch looks like it has been rebased (i.e. published history has been re-written).

### Git: New settings

Additionally, new Git settings have been added:

* `git.requireGitUserConfig` - In VS Code 1.51 we made a privacy change to require a user name or email address before committing. You can now disable that requirement if desired.
* `git.ignoreRebaseWarning` - Disables the new warning when pulling (or sync'ing) and and the current branch has been rebased.
* `git.autofetch` - Auto fetch can now additionally be set to `all` to fetch all remotes, thanks to [PR #111090](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/111090) by [@jasonwilliams (Jason Williams)](https://github.com/jasonwilliams):

## Preview features

### Search in open editors

This release comes with experimental support for searching in open editors, which has been a [highly requested feature](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/20530) for some time. This feature is enabled by default in Insiders, and can be enabled with the `search.experimental.searchInOpenEditors` setting in Stable.

![Searching in open editors](images/1_53/SearchInOpenEditors.gif)

### TypeScript 4.2 support

This release continues to improve our support for the upcoming TypeScript 4.2 release. You can read more about the new language features and improvements in TypeScript 4.2 [on the TypeScript blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-2-beta/). Here are some of the editor improvements it enables:

* JS Doc templates now generate `@returns`.
* Deprecated DOM APIs are now marked as such.
* A quick fix to declare missing functions.
* Native support for semantic highlighting, instead of using a TypeScript service plugin.

To start using the TypeScript 4.2 nightly builds, just install the [TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next). Please share feedback and let us know if you run into any bugs with TypeScript 4.2.

### New Find References to File command

If you are using TypeScript 4.2, you can also try the new **Find References to File** command for JavaScript and TypeScript to find all places where a file is being referenced.

![Finding all references to a file](images/1_53/ts-file-references.png)

You can trigger this command in a few different ways:

* For the active file using **TypeScript: Find File References** command.
* Right-click on an editor tab and select **Find File References**.
* Right-click on a file in the File Explorer and select **Find File References**.

## Extension authoring

### Extension guidelines

There is now a set of detailed [extension guidelines](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/extension-guidelines) for extension authors. The guidelines cover best practices for contributing to VS Code's users interface and conventions for notifications and status updates.

As an example, below are the Do's and Dont's for contributing commands to the Command Palette:

![Extension guidelines for contributing to the Command Palette](images/1_53/command-palette-dos-and-donts.png)

### Status bar entry background color API

The previously proposed `backgroundColor` for the `StatusBarItem` API is now stable. Currently only `statusBarItem.errorBackground` is supported to avoid the Status bar looking too colorful. We may expand this support to more colors in the future.

![Status bar error in red](images/1_52/status-error.png)

The use case for this new API is to enable extensions to indicate error conditions in the Status bar. For example, the ESLint extension may decide to use this color to alert the user that ESLint has not yet been enabled for a workspace.

### Adding CancellationError type

We have added a new error type: `vscode.CancellationError`. This type can be used in response to a `CancellationToken` being canceled or when an operation is being canceled by the executor of that operation.

### OnEnterRule.previousLineText

It is now possible to target the text on the previous line when evaluating an `OnEnterRule` using the newly added property `previousLineText`.

### onEnterRules in language configuration files

Until now, `onEnterRules` could be defined only using the `vscode.languages.setLanguageConfiguration` API. Now, `onEnterRules` can also be defined in the language configuration file.

For example:

```json
  "onEnterRules": [
    {
      "beforeText": "^\\s*(?:def|class|for|if|elif|else|while|try|with|finally|except|async).*?:\\s*$",
      "action": { "indent": "indent" }
    }
  ]
```

### Semantic token commands

There are now new commands to invoke the semantic tokens provider. The commands are:

* `vscode.provideDocumentSemanticTokensLegend` with an argument of type `Uri`
* `vscode.provideDocumentSemanticTokens` with an argument of type `Uri`
* `vscode.provideDocumentRangeSemanticTokensLegend` with an argument of type `Uri`
* `vscode.provideDocumentRangeSemanticTokens` with two arguments: the first an `Uri` and the second a `Range`.

### Secrets API

Similar to the storage API, there is now an API for storing and retrieving secrets on a per-extension basis. This allows extensions to store sensitive information in the OS credential manager or keystore.

### workspaceContains extension activation behavior change

This month, we fixed a bug with the behavior of the `workspaceContains` extension activation event that could change how an extension is activated.

The bug caused us to start a search over the entire workspace, when the `workspaceContains` pattern was only targeting files in the root of the workspace. Since this could impact the startup performance of VS Code, we needed to fix this and scope these searches correctly. But as a result, some extensions that were previously activated by this behavior may no longer get activated.

The change has been in our Insiders build since the beginning of January. For more details, [see this comment](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/110510#issuecomment-770133700) on the GitHub issue.

### Updated loading icon

We've updated our loading icon to make for a smoother experience.

![Loading icon](images/1_53/loading-icon.gif)

### Git: New Git Extension APIs

* A new `API.onDidPublish` event has been added, which fires when a repository or branch is published from the VS Code Git extension.
* A new `API.openRepository` method has been added, to allow extensions to tell the Git extension about other Git repositories, e.g. outside the workspace, or more deeply nested within it.
* The `API.push` method now has an additional optional `force` parameter.
* The `API.commit` method's `CommitOptions` now has an additional optional `requireUserConfig` to avoid requiring a user or email address.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Inline value provider API

Today the **Show Inline Values** feature of VS Code's debugger is based on a generic implementation in VS Code core, and doesn't provide customizability through settings or extensibility via extensions. As a consequence, it is not a perfect fit for all languages and sometimes shows incorrect values because it doesn't understand the underlying source language. For this reason, we are working on an extension API that allows to replace the built-in implementation completely or to replace parts of the implementation with custom code.

In this milestone, we have created an [initial proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/105690). If you are interested in this extension API, we'd appreciate your feedback.

### Testing

We are investigating [testing in VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/107467), and the first version of the API is now present in `vscode.proposed.d.ts`. Please read the linked issue for more context, and participate if you have input.

This iteration focused building out the "Selfhost Test Provider" for VS Code and foundational UI, primarily the test explorer, gutter decorations, and peek views for results.

![Screenshot of a failed test with a diff peek view open showing the difference between actual and expected values.](images/1_53/testing.png)
*Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong)*

### External URI opener

The proposed external URI opener API allows extensions to handle opening HTTP and HTTPS links that the user selects in the editor. For example, a browser preview extension could use this to open links to a local server in VS Code directly, instead of opening the link with the user's default browser:

To use the external opener API, first add an `onUriOpen` activation event for the URL schemes your opener supports. Currently only `http` and `https` URLs are supported:

```json
"activationEvents": [
  "onUriOpen:http",
  "onUriOpen:https"
]
```

Then in your extension's activation, call `registerExternalUriOpener` to register your external uri opener:

```ts
vscode.window.registerExternalUriOpener('myExtension.opener', {
  canOpenExternalUri(uri: vscode.Uri) {
    // Check if a uri can be opened.
    // This is called when the user first selects a link and VS Code
    // needs to determine which openers are available.

    if (uri.authority === 'localhost:8080') {
      // This opener has default priority for this uri.
      // This will result in the user being prompted since VS Code always has
      // its own default opener.
      return vscode.ExternalUriOpenerPriority.Default;
    }

    // The opener can be used but should not be used by default
    return vscode.ExternalUriOpenerPriority.Option;
  },
  openExternalUri(resolveUri: vscode.Uri) {
    // Actually open the uri.
    // This is called once the user has selected this opener.
  }
}, {
  schemes: ['http', 'https'],
  label: localize('openTitle', "Open URL using My Extension"),
});
```

Now when you click links to `localhost:8080` in the editor or terminal, you will be prompted to select how the URL should be opened:

![Selecting the opener for a URI](images/1_53/external-opener-prompt.png)

Additionally, you can configure a default opener for a uri using the new `workbench.externalUriOpeners` setting:

```json
"workbench.externalUriOpeners": {
  "localhost:8081": "myExtension.opener"
}
```

## Language Server Protocol

Work has started on the [3.17](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-17) version of the protocol. The first proposed feature is support for a more detailed completion item label.

### Language Server Index Format

We also improved the LSIF indexer for TypeScript and tested it against a broader range of open-source repositories. Major improvements are:

* A tolerant index mode that uses more memory but doesn't fail if a symbol's moniker is not correctly computed (see `--moniker` command-line option).
* Log file support to help find situations where monikers can't be correctly computed.
* A new LSIF dump validation tool (lsif-tooling). The tools can be used with dumps produced by any tool. It is not constraint to the TypeScript indexer. The tool checks and LSIF dump for:
  * Correct vertex and edge layout (for example, correct properties and types of the properties)
  * That vertices are emitted before the are referenced in edges
  * The cardinality of edges
  * The outgoing and incoming type of edges.
  * The dump is portioned correctly (for example, no result partitions are added to documents / projects that are already closed)

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Value dataBreakpoint from VariablePresentationHint.kind is deprecated

Currently, we can detect whether an object has a data breakpoint by checking for the `dataBreakpoint` kind from `VariablePresentationHint`. However, the variable `kind` is generally used to identify the actual type of the object - that is, if it's an interface, a method, or a derived class. Data breakpoint tracking, which is used for UI purposes, should be declared as an `attribute` instead, since that can be set alongside other attributes and variable kinds.

Consequently, we have deprecated the value `dataBreakpoint` from the `kind` property of the `VariablePresentationHint` and added a new value `hasDataBreakpoint` for the `attribute` property of the `VariablePresentationHint`.

## Engineering

### Electron 11 update

In this milestone, we finished the exploration to bundle Electron 11 into VS Code, thanks to everyone involved with testing and self-hosting on insiders. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chromium 87.0.4280.141 and Node.js 12.18.3.

**Breaking change**

As a side effect of this update, we had to bump our build image to use `Ubuntu-18.04` for `x64` linux machines to consume Electron. This update raised the minimum GLIBCXX requirement to `3.4.22` for our native modules, which breaks support for older distros on desktop. After some changes to the build system, we were able to go back as far as using gcc-5 toolchain, which brings the minimum GLIBCXX requirement to `3.4.21`. With these changes, the following are the distros known to work for the `x64` desktop app:

* Ubuntu 16.04 and newer
* Fedora 24 and newer
* Debian 9 and newer
* CentOS 8 and newer

**Note:** Our remote development components continue to use GLIBCXX `3.4.19`, so there is no change in supported platforms.

A workaround for the other distros would be to install gcc-5 or higher toolchain to avoid the GLIBCXX error with native modules, but there is no guarantee that all components of the runtime will work fine. There is also the option of using our [remote development suite](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) to work with the older distros.

### Apple Silicon

Thanks to the work by the Electron team, Electron 11 update allowed us to consume the arm64 binaries published for Apple Silicon and thanks to the community for self-hosting with the insiders build, catching issues early on. We are now happy to announce our first release of stable Apple Silicon builds this iteration.

![Screenshot of website showing the new downloads view for Apple Silicon builds](images/1_53/apple-silicon-download.png)

We currently offer three variations of downloads under macOS,

* `x64` version for Mac devices with Intel chip
* `arm64` version for Mac devices with Apple Silicon chip
* `universal` version that can run natively on either of the above devices

The `universal` version will be provided as default download option on the website, this is an important decision as we will work towards removing the architecture specific downloads later this year, more updates on this will follow in upcoming iteration.

![Screenshot of website showing the default download for macOS](images/1_53/macOS-universal-download.png)

Universal apps are created by bundling both `x64` and `arm64` version of the apps, hence there is a significant increase in download size for the first install but simplifies the transition for a user to the new Apple Silicon macs.

### Progress on Electron sandbox

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window fit for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation).

**Specifically:**

* The IPC connection to our background shared process changed from a Node.js socket connection to using Electron's [MessagePort](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/message-port-main) API.
* There is a new internal option to enable the experimental `vscode-file` protocol for the main window that enables us to do some selfhosting (the issue reporter and process explorer already run with this option since last milestone).
* We removed the more direct Node.js API that is used in the VS Code window.

### VS Code is now Trusted Types compliant

We have finished the work to make VS Code trusted types compliant per the [W3C Trusted Types](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-trusted-types) specification.

## Documentation

### Remote Development

Check out our new [Beginner's Series to: Dev Containers](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-Dev-Containers?WT.mc_id=devcloud-11496-cxa), a set of eight videos that show you how to get, create, and configure a container-based development environment using VS Code [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

![Beginner's dev containers videos series](images/1_53/containers-series.png)

### when clause reference

The `when` clause documentation is now in its own [when clause contexts reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/when-clause-contexts). Here you can learn how to [conditionally](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/when-clause-contexts#_conditional-operators) enable or disable custom keybindings depending on the currently active VS Code UI ([contexts](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/when-clause-contexts#_available-contexts)) and tune the visibility of menus and views when contributing extensions.

```json
{ "key": "f5",  "command": "workbench.action.debug.start",
                   "when": "debuggersAvailable && debugState != 'initializing'" }
```

### CodeTour for educators

A new [CodeTour](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/educators/codetour) topic introduces educators to the [CodeTour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) extension that lets them easily author walkthroughs for codebases. Educators can create self-paced tours for their students as they ramp up on new projects and assignments.

![CodeTour extension](images/1_53/codetour-extension.png)
