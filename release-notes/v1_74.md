# November 2022 (version 1.74)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.74 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Accessibility

### Settings editor indicators and links

The indicators and links in the Settings editor are now navigable by keyboard, including the hover contents.

### Audio cues for diff review mode

In a diff editor, when `Go to Next Difference` is triggered, a specific audio cue will play to indicate whether the cursor is on an inserted or deleted line.

## Workbench

### Allow customization of Explorer autoreveal logic via `explorer.autoRevealExclude`

The highly upvoted issue [Allow to set explorer.autoReveal per specific folder](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87956) has been closed with the introduction of a new setting `explorer.autoRevealExclude`. This allows for configuring which files get autorevealed in the explorer if the autorevealing is enabled. The setting follows the same pattern as `files.exclude` by also supporting sibling matching via when clauses.

### Ability to hide badges per view container

Similar to how you were able to hide view containers by right-clicking the view container, we've now introduced the ability to hide the badges often indicating a number, icon, or progress on the container.

## Tasks

### Task actions in the terminal dropdown

The **Run Task** and **Configure Task** commands appear in the terminal dropdown for increased discoverability and ease of access.

## Source Control

### Manage unsafe git repositories

VS Code uses `git.exe` for executing all git operations. Starting with Git [2.35.2](https://github.blog/2022-04-18-highlights-from-git-2-36/#stricter-repository-ownership-checks), users are prevented from running git operations in a repository that is in a folder that owned by a user other than the current user as the repository is deemed to be potentially unsafe.

Starting with this release, if one tries to open such a potentially unsafe repository, VS Code will show a welcome view in the Source Control view as well as an error notification. Both the welcome view, and the notification expose the **Manage Unsafe Repositories** command that enables user to review the list of potentially unsafe repositories, mark them as safe, and open them. The **Manage Unsafe Repositories** command is also available in the command palette. Marking a repository as safe will add the repository location to the `safe.directory` [git configuration](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-safedirectory).

### Optimistic user-interface updates

After executing a git operation, a set of git commands (ex: `git status`) are executed to update the data model before the Source Control view is updated. There are scenarios in which running these commands can take several seconds to complete (ex: working with large monorepos), resulting in a delay before the Source Control view is refreshed.

This milestone we have made changes so that the Source Control view is optimistically updated for some of the git operations (stage, un-stage, discard changes, and commit) before `git status` completes resulting in a snappier Source Control view.

The new capability is enabled by default but it can be disabled using `git.optimisticUpdate: false`.

### Commit action button polish

This milestone we have polished the **Commit** action button so that when executing a secondary commit command (ex: "Commit & Sync"), the action button label correctly reflects the command being executed. The **Commit** action button will also show an animation indicating progress.

## Terminal

### Terminal Quick Fix improvements

Terminal Quick Fixes are now presented in a Code Action control to align with the experience in the editor.

## Remote Development

[Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels) is now available as a preview feature on VS Code stable. Remote tunnels allow you to securely access your machine with VS Code from any device, anywhere. To enable remote tunnel access, you can **either**:

* Choose **Turn on Remote Tunnel Access** from the Account menu or Command Palette.
* Run `code tunnel` from a machine with VS Code installed and on the PATH.
* [Download the new VS Code CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) and run `./code tunnel`.

Once tunnel access is turned on, you can connect to the machine from any device using [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev), or using the Remote Tunnels extensions from VS Code desktop.

To find out more, check out our [blog post announcing the feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/12/07/remote-event-better) or the [remote tunnel documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels).

> **Note:** If you were using the standalone `code-server` CLI, you should now use the the VS Code CLI (via the latest VS Code Desktop or the standalone download mentioned above) instead.

## Debugging

### JavaScript debugging

**Support for console.profile**

The JavaScript debugger now supports [`console.profile`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/profile). When running under the debugger, a CPU profile will be collected for code between `console.profile()` and `console.profileEnd()`.

```js
console.profile();
doSomeExpensiveWork();
console.profileEnd();
```

The resulting `.cpuprofile` file will be saved in your workspace folder, and can be opened and viewed using VS Code's built-in profile viewer.

**Support for nested sourcemaps**

Sometimes, especially in monorepo setups, code might be compiled once and then re-compiled or bundled again. In many cases, this would result in sourcemaps of the resulting bundle referencing the compiled files created in the first step.

The JavaScript debugger will now automatically resolve sourcemaps recursively, so that the original source files can be debugged without extra steps.

## Extension authoring

### Implicit activation events for declared extension contributions

This milestone we have removed the requirement to explicitly list activation events if your extension declares certain extension contributions in its package.json.

Previously, if an extension declared that it contributed a command `mycommand` in its `package.json` file, it also needed to list the corresponding `onCommand:mycommand` activation event in the `activationEvents` field of `package.json` for the command to successfully execute. This was tedious and error-prone and could lead to large `package.json` files.

VS Code will now automatically populate activation events for the following extension contribution points:

| Contribution point | Inferred activation event |
| --- | --- |
| `commands` | `onCommand` |
| `authentication` | `onAuthenticationRequest` |
| `languages` | `onLanguage` |
| `customEditors` | `onCustomEditor` |
| `views` | `onView` |

Extension authors can now safely remove these inferred activation events from your extensions. If you do so, update your VS Code engine requirement to ensure that your extension is not treated as compatible with earlier versions of VS Code:

```json
    "engines": {
        "vscode": "^1.74.0"
    },
```

## Debug Adapter Protocol

Several clarifications and a new property were added to the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol).

* The `DataBreakpointInfo` request has a new optional `frameId` property. Clients can use this flag to specify which stack frame contains a `name` variable.
* End-of-file behavior is now specified for the `readMemory` request.

## Engineering

### Name mangling of properties and method

Our product build now mangles names of properties and methods. This reduced the size of our main bundles by ~13% (-1.5 MB) and reduces code loading times by ~5%.

### Window Controls Overlay re-enabled by default on Windows

The Window Controls Overlay (WCO) has been re-enabled. Previously, it was rendering on the wrong side for users using right-to-left system languages, covering up the File and Edit menu items for them. Fortunately, that issue has now been fixed by passing the application locale to the Electron backend, and by adding some new Electron APIs so that VS Code's language pack recommender can continue to work even when the Electron locale has been changed.

![VS Code with the custom title bar along with Paint's title bar. The screenshot is taken on Windows 11 with the system language in Arabic, showing that the WCO is on the right for VS Code, which is in English, while it is on the left for Paint, which is in Arabic.](images/1_74/wco-rtl-example.png)

## Notable fixes

* [166171](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/166171) Remove the default scroll bar in the extensions' tip modal.

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
