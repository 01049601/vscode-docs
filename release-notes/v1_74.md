Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.74 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Accessibility

### Settings editor indicators and links

The indicators and links in the Settings editor are now navigable by keyboard, including the hover contents.

## Engineering

### Mangling of properties and method

Our product build now mangles names of properties and methods. This reduced the size of our main bundles by ~13% (-1.5MB) and reduces code loading times by ~5%.

### Window Controls Overlay re-enabled by default

The application locale is now passed to Electron on Windows and Linux. On Windows, this change means that the Window Controls Overlay (WCO) now shows up on the correct side for VS Code, even when the system is using a right-to-left language.

Thus, the setting `window.experimental.windowControlsOverlay.enabled` has been re-enabled by default again.

## Notable fixes

* [166171](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/166171) Remove the default scroll bar in the extensions' tip modal.
