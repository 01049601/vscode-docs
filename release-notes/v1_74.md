Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.74 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Accessibility

### Settings editor indicators and links

The indicators and links in the Settings editor are now navigable by keyboard, including the hover contents.

### Audio cues for diff review mode

In a diff editor, when `Go to Next Difference` is triggered, a specific audio cue will play to indicate whether the cursor is on an inserted or deleted line.

## Tasks

### Task actions in the terminal dropdown

`Run Task` and `Configure Task` actions appear in the terminal dropdown for increased discoverability and ease of access

## Terminal

### Terminal quick fix improvements

Terminal quick fixes are now presented in a rich action widget to align with the experience in the editor.

## Engineering

### Mangling of properties and method

Our product build now mangles names of properties and methods. This reduced the size of our main bundles by ~13% (-1.5MB) and reduces code loading times by ~5%.

### Window Controls Overlay re-enabled by default on Windows

The Window Controls Overlay (WCO) has been re-enabled. Previously, it was rendering on the wrong side for users using right-to-left system languages, covering up the File and Edit menu items for them. Fortunately, that issue has now been fixed by passing the application locale to the Electron backend, and by adding some new Electron APIs so that VS Code's language pack recommender can continue to work even when the Electron locale has been changed.

The screenshot is taken on Windows 11 with the system language in Arabic, showing that the WCO is on the right for VS Code, which is in English, while it is on the left for Paint, which is in Arabic.](images/1_74/wco-rtl-example.png)

## Notable fixes

* [166171](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/166171) Remove the default scroll bar in the extensions' tip modal.
