## Accessibility

### Settings editor indicators and links

The indicators and links in the Settings editor are now navigable by keyboard, including the hover contents.

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/mgwg.light-pink-theme))_

### Audio cues for diff review mode

In a diff editor, when `Go to Next Difference` is triggered, a specific audio cue will play to indicate whether the cursor is on an inserted or deleted line.

### Audio cues for notebook execution

We've added audio cues to play when notebook cells finish executing. The cue is different to indicate whether the cell ran successfully or failed.

## Workbench

### Allow customization of Explorer autoreveal logic via `explorer.autoRevealExclude`

The highly upvoted issue [Allow to set explorer.autoReveal per specific folder](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87956) has been closed with the introduction of a new setting `explorer.autoRevealExclude`. This allows for configuring which files get autorevealed in the explorer if the autorevealing is enabled. The setting follows the same pattern as `files.exclude` by also supporting sibling matching via when clauses.

### Ability to hide badges per view container

Similar to how you were able to hide view containers by right-clicking the view container, we've now introduced the ability to hide the badges often indicating a number, icon, or progress on the container.

![A context menu is triggered on the SCM view showing a 'hide badge' entry. This is then acted upon and the blue number one badge disappears. Triggering the context menu again shows a 'show badge' entry which brings the blue badge number one badge back.](images/1_74/hide-view-badge.gif)

### Install an extension located in the disk

You can now install an extension that is located in the disk by using `Developer: Install Extension from Location...` command.

## Tasks

### Task actions in the terminal dropdown

The **Run Task** and **Configure Task** commands appear in the terminal dropdown for increased discoverability and ease of access.

![the last section of the terminal dropdown menu contains run task and configure task actions](images/1_74/task-action-dropdown.png)

## Source Control

### Manage unsafe git repositories

VS Code uses `git.exe` for executing all git operations. Starting with Git [2.35.2](https://github.blog/2022-04-18-highlights-from-git-2-36/#stricter-repository-ownership-checks), users are prevented from running git operations in a repository that is in a folder that owned by a user other than the current user as the repository is deemed to be potentially unsafe.

Starting with this release, if one tries to open such a potentially unsafe repository, VS Code will show a welcome view in the Source Control view as well as an error notification. Both the welcome view, and the notification expose the **Manage Unsafe Repositories** command that enables user to review the list of potentially unsafe repositories, mark them as safe, and open them. The **Manage Unsafe Repositories** command is also available in the command palette. Marking a repository as safe will add the repository location to the `safe.directory` [git configuration](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-safedirectory).

### Optimistic user-interface updates

After executing a git operation, a set of git commands (ex: `git status`) are executed to update the data model before the Source Control view is updated. There are scenarios in which running these commands can take several seconds to complete (ex: working with large monorepos), resulting in a delay before the Source Control view is refreshed.

This milestone we have made changes so that the Source Control view is optimistically updated for some of the git operations (stage, un-stage, discard changes, and commit) before `git status` completes resulting in a snappier Source Control view.

The new capability is enabled by default but it can be disabled using `git.optimisticUpdate: false`.

### Commit action button polish

This milestone we have polished the **Commit** action button so that when executing a secondary commit command (ex: "Commit & Sync"), the action button label correctly reflects the command being executed. The **Commit** action button will also show an animation indicating progress.

## Terminal

### Terminal Quick Fix improvements

Terminal Quick Fixes are now presented in a Code Action control to align with the experience in the editor.

![A quick fix is triggered in the terminal and a menu is presented with a play button to the left of the action's label](images/1_74/terminal-action-widget.png)

## Remote Development

[Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels) is now available as a preview feature on VS Code stable. Remote tunnels allow you to securely access your machine with VS Code from any device, anywhere. To enable remote tunnel access, you can **either**:

* Choose **Turn on Remote Tunnel Access** from the Account menu or Command Palette.
* Run `code tunnel` from a machine with VS Code installed and on the PATH.
* [Download the new VS Code CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) and run `./code tunnel`.

Once tunnel access is turned on, you can connect to the machine from any device using [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev), or using the Remote Tunnels extensions from VS Code desktop.

To find out more, check out our [blog post announcing the feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/12/07/remote-event-better) or the [remote tunnel documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels).

_Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong)_

> **Note:** If you were using the standalone `code-server` CLI, you should now use the VS Code CLI (via the latest VS Code Desktop or the standalone download mentioned above) instead.

## Debugging

### JavaScript debugging

**Support for console.profile**

The JavaScript debugger now supports [`console.profile`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/profile). When running under the debugger, a CPU profile will be collected for code between `console.profile()` and `console.profileEnd()`.

```js
console.profile();
doSomeExpensiveWork();
console.profileEnd();
```

The resulting `.cpuprofile` file will be saved in your workspace folder, and can be opened and viewed using VS Code's built-in profile viewer.

**Support for nested sourcemaps**

Sometimes, especially in monorepo setups, code might be compiled once and then re-compiled or bundled again. In many cases, this would result in sourcemaps of the resulting bundle referencing the compiled files created in the first step.

The JavaScript debugger will now automatically resolve sourcemaps recursively, so that the original source files can be debugged without extra steps.

## Languages

### TypeScript 4.9

VS Code now ships with TypeScript 4.9. This major update brings new TypeScript language features such as the [`satisfies` operator](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9/#satisfies) and [auto accessors](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9/#auto-accessors-in-classes). On the tooling side, we've made improvements to [file watching](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9/#file-watching-changes) and made a number of other fixes and improvements.

Check out the [TypeScript 4.9 announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9/) for more about this update.

### Go to definition on `return`

JavaScript and TypeScript now support running `Go to Definition` on the `return` keyword to quickly jump to the top of the function being returned from. This is helpful when dealing with long and complicated, or highly nested functions. You can use the `Go to Definition` command/keybinding for this or simply cmd/alt click on the `return` keyword.

## Notebooks

### Kernel picker experiment: most recently used kernels

We are adding an experimental kernel picker that shows the most recently used kernels at the top of the picker. This is an opt-in experiment that can be enabled by setting the `notebook.kernelPicker.type` setting to `mru`.

Kernels that are not used will be moved into a secondary picker "Select Another Kernel...". This picker will group all kernels by their source (ex: Jupyter Kernel, Python Environment, etc. when you have latest [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) installed).

![Kernel picker with most recently used kernels](images/1_74/kernel-picker.gif)

This is an experimental feature and we would love to hear your feedback. Please create an issue in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).

## VS Code for the Web

### Source control

VS Code for the Web now supports the following settings when editing GitHub and Azure Repos repositories:

- `"git.branchRandomName.enabled"`: Generate random branch name when creating branches in VS Code for the Web.
- `"git.branchRandomName.dictionary"`: Specify word dictionaries for generating random branch names when creating branches in VS Code for the Web.
- `"git.closeDiffOnOperation"`: Close diff editors after performing source control operations like committing, staging, unstaging changes.

Additionally, we display a lock icon in the status bar and the branch picker for protected branches in VS Code for the Web, aligning with the experience on VS Code on the desktop.
![Lock icon for protected branches in status bar and branch picker](images/1_74/lock-branch.png)

Finally, you can now use the source control action button in VS Code for the Web to commit and push your changes directly to the repository remote:
![Commit & Push using source control action button](images/1_74/scm-action-button.png)

If you wish to validate your changes before committing, you can also use the secondary **Continue Working On...** action in the action button dropdown to take your working changes to another development environment.

### Improvements to Continue Working On

When you are in a GitHub or Azure Repos repository, there are now convenient 1-step commands available in the command palette to take your working changes with you to a specific development environment:
* Continue Working in a New Codespace
* Continue Working in Local Clone
* Continue Working in Remote Repository on VS Code Desktop
![1-step commands to continue working in another development environment](images/1_74/continue-on-command-palette.png)

We have also renamed **Edit Sessions** to **Cloud Changes** to clarify that it relates to storing working changes in the cloud.

## Preview features

### Profiles

We have been working the last couple of months to support **Profiles** in VS Code, which is one of the most popular asks from the community. This feature is available for preview via the `workbench.experimental.settingsProfiles.enabled` setting. Try it out and give us your feedback by creating issues in the [vscode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) or commenting in [issue #116740](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/116740).

#### Sharing Profiles

You can now share a profile by exporting it to GitHub as a gist. VS Code will create a secret gist using your GitHub account and provides you a link to share it with others. When you open that link, VS Code will ask you to install the shared profile. During exporting or importing a profile, VS Code will show a preview of it so that you can review and choose data to export or import respectively.

Here is a video showing exporting a profile to GitHub and copying the link to share it with others

## Extension authoring

### Implicit activation events for declared extension contributions

This milestone we have removed the requirement to explicitly list activation events if your extension declares certain extension contributions in its package.json.

Previously, if an extension declared that it contributed a command `mycommand` in its `package.json` file, it also needed to list the corresponding `onCommand:mycommand` activation event in the `activationEvents` field of `package.json` for the command to successfully execute. This was tedious and error-prone and could lead to large `package.json` files.

VS Code will now automatically populate activation events for the following extension contribution points:

| Contribution point | Inferred activation event |
| --- | --- |
| `commands` | `onCommand` |
| `authentication` | `onAuthenticationRequest` |
| `languages` | `onLanguage` |
| `customEditors` | `onCustomEditor` |
| `views` | `onView` |

Extension authors can now safely remove these inferred activation events from your extensions. If you do so, update your VS Code engine requirement to ensure that your extension is not treated as compatible with earlier versions of VS Code:

```json
    "engines": {
        "vscode": "^1.74.0"
    },
```

### Log output channel

In this milestone we finialized the [LogOutputChannel](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/930fd0e469a43fd923cd732c178e3cc9e878b58d/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L6474) API. You can now use this API to create a log output channel that will be used to log messages from your extension.

We also finalized [logLevel](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/930fd0e469a43fd923cd732c178e3cc9e878b58d/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L9464) property and [onDidChangeLogLevel](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/930fd0e469a43fd923cd732c178e3cc9e878b58d/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L9469) event to `env` namespace to represent the current log level of the application and the event is fired when the log level changes for the application.

### Consistent origin for all webviews

Following up on [our work last iteration](./v1_73.md#consistent-origin-for-webviews-and-webview-views), all webviews in VS Code now try to maintain custom origins. With 1.74, this also extends to the webviews used by custom editors.

This improvements performance by allowing webview content to be cached in more cases. See the [previous release notes](./v1_73.md#consistent-origin-for-webviews-and-webview-views) for more details and things to be aware of as an extension author.

### Video tag support in extension readmes

Extensions can now use `<video>` tags in their readmes. Videos are supported on both the VS Code marketplace and on extension pages in VS Code. Compared to gifs, video files are higher quality and often smaller too. You can even include audio!

Keep in mind that [only specific video and audio formats are supported in VS Code itself](/api/extension-guides/webview.md#supported-media-formats). At present, you must also use an full path to the `<video>` `src` and `poster` instead of a relative path.


## Debug Adapter Protocol

Several clarifications and a new property were added to the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol).

* The `DataBreakpointInfo` request has a new optional `frameId` property. Clients can use this flag to specify which stack frame contains a `name` variable.
* End-of-file behavior is now specified for the `readMemory` request.

## Contributions to extensions

### Jupyter

#### "Just My Code" for notebook cell debugging

The "Just My Code" debug feature allows the user to determine whether the debugger will step through code from Python libraries, or will only step through user code. This has been enabled by default when debugging a notebook cell, and you can now set `"jupyter.debugJustMyCode": false` to disable it and allow stepping through library code. For the best experience, upgrade debugpy in your environment to `>=1.6.3`. Previously, this setting was only respected for debugging using the Interactive Window. Now it is respected in notebook editors as well.

#### Support restarting notebook cell debug sessions

The **Restart** command in the debug toolbar restarts the current debug session. Previously this threw an error in notebook debug sessions, but now it is supported in the notebook editor. Unfortunately it can't be properly supported in the Interactive Window.

This feature is especially useful in a workflow where you debug, edit the cell, then restart the debug session to debug the cell again with your edits applied.

## Engineering

### Name mangling of properties and method

Our product build now mangles names of properties and methods. This reduced the size of our main bundles by ~13% (-1.5 MB) and reduces code loading times by ~5%.

### Window Controls Overlay re-enabled by default on Windows

The Window Controls Overlay (WCO) has been re-enabled. Previously, it was rendering on the wrong side for users using right-to-left system languages, covering up the File and Edit menu items for them. Fortunately, that issue has now been fixed by passing the application locale to the Electron backend, and by adding some new Electron APIs so that VS Code's language pack recommender can continue to work even when the Electron locale has been changed.

![VS Code with the custom title bar along with Paint's title bar. The screenshot is taken on Windows 11 with the system language in Arabic, showing that the WCO is on the right for VS Code, which is in English, while it is on the left for Paint, which is in Arabic.](images/1_74/wco-rtl-example.png)

### Built-in extensions now use the new `l10n` API instead of `vscode-nls`

Last month we stablized the new [Localization (l10n) API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#l10n). This month, we have adopted that API in every extension found in the [Microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions) repository. We still need to move language servers over to using `@vscode/l10n` over `vscode-nls` and move some other extensions that the team owns (JS Debug, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, etc) but we are moving in the right direction to a single localization story for all of our extensions.

### GitHub & Microsoft Authentication extensions bundle size improvments

The bundle sizes for these extensions were more than we wanted them to be given what the provided and how critical they are for startup in a lot of cases (like vscode.dev). This milestone, we focused on decreasing the size of these. Here are the results:

* GitHub Authentication: 93kb -> 64.9kb
* Microsoft Authentcation: 97kb -> 57.7kb

This was achieved by:

* No longer depending (and bundling) node_modules that provided functionality that is readily available in node.js and the web (ex. removing uuid in favor of [Crypto.randomUUID()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/randomUUID)).
* Only using `node-fetch` in node instead of using it for both node and the web.
* Adopting the newest version of `@vscode/extension-telemetry` whos size decreased considerably.

No functionality was lost in this process and now these extensions are fetched faster and load faster with this decreased size.

## Notable fixes

* [166171](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/166171) Remove the default scroll bar in the extensions' tip modal.
* [microsoft/vscode-jupyter#11745](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/11745) Variables viewer causes slowness and instability
