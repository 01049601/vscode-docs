# October 2020 (version 1.51)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.51 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/108473)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22October+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### More prominent pinned tabs

Pinned tabs will now always show their pin icon, even while inactive, to make it easier to identify them. If an editor is both pinned and dirty, the icon reflects both states.

### Extension trees use custom hover

Instead of using the native tooltip in extension tree views, we now use a custom hover that is consistent cross-platform and fits better with the overall UX.

### Extensions: Install an Extension without Synchronizing

You can now install an extension without synchronizing it when Settings Sync is enabled.

## IntelliSense

### Resizable suggest widget

This milestone, we've made several improvements to the suggest widget. First and foremost: it can now be resized! Drag the sides or corners to resize the widget.

![Resizable Suggest Widget](images/1_51/suggest-drag.gif)

_Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)_, _Font_: FiraCode

The size of the suggestions list will be saved and restored across sessions. The size of the details pane is only saved per session, since the size is more variable. Also, the `editor.suggest.maxVisibleSuggestions` setting has become obsolete.

### Status bar for suggestions

The suggest widget can now also show a status bar at its bottom. Enable it using the `editor.suggestStatusBar.enable` setting. It makes toggling details simpler and shows if a completion supports inserting, replacing or both.

![Suggest Status Bar](images/1_51/suggest-status.png)

_Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)_, _Font_: FiraCode

In the sample above, selecting "Insert" results in `Math.floorceil` and selecting "Replace" results in `Math.floor`.

The new `editor.suggest.insertMode` setting allows you to configure whether you prefer insert or replace. When a suggestion supports both, your preference will be the default.

### Move cursor to select suggestions

Last but not least, you can now move the cursor while suggestions are showing. For instance, you can trigger suggestions at the end of a word, move left to see more suggestions, and then use replace to overwrite the word.

![Suggest Status Bar](images/1_51/suggest-left.gif)

## Emmet

Custom snippets in Emmet work again! Additionally, snippets now automatically refresh upon saving the snippets file or updating `emmet.extensionsPath`.

![Emmet Custom Snippets Working Again](images/1_51/emmet-custom-snippets.gif)

## Source Control

### Source Control input box saves commit message history

This addresses a **[feature request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/26952)** to navigate SCM commit history. Press the up and down arrow keys to display the prior and next commits, respectively. To move directly to the first and last position of the input box, press the alt key in conjunction with the corresponding arrow key. Build off of past commit messages and look back in the history without losing your drafted message.

![After typing a message in the SCM input box, then staging and committing changes, pressing the up arrow reveals the message that was just committed.](images/1_51/scm-commit-history-demo.gif)

## Markdown smart select

Expand and shrink selection in markdown documents using:
> Windows
>> Expand: Shift+Alt+→
>> Shrink: Shift+Alt+←

> Mac
>> Expand: ⌃⇧⌘→
>> Shrink: ⌃⇧⌘←

Selection applies to headers and their content in a hierarchical way; for example, in a markdown document, expand selection selects an html code block on the cursor line, the list containing it, the rest of the content under the subheader, the subheader, the content of the parent header, the parent header, the content of the grandparent header, the grandparent header, and finally the contents of the document. Pressing the keybinding to shrink the selection reverses that process.

## Browser support

### Download folders (Edge, Chrome)

Leveraging the new [File System Access](https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/) API, VS Code running in a browser can now offer a download action for folders from the File Explorer to download all files and folders to disk.

![Download folder](images/1_51/download-folder.gif)

**Note:** This requires a recent Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome browser.

### Open Workspace notification

If you open a folder that contains `.code-workspace` files top level, you now see a notification asking to open it. This was always the case in VS Code for desktop and will now work in the browser too.

![Workspace notification](images/1_51/open-workspace.png)

### Prevent accidental close

A new setting `window.confirmBeforeClose` was added to show a confirmation dialog before closing or leaving the workbench.

Possible values are:

* `keyboardOnly` The confirmation will only be shown when you use a keybinding to close (for example `Ctrl+W` or `Cmd+W`). (default)
* `always`: The confirmation dialog will always be shown, even if you close from a mouse gesture.
* `never`: The confirmation will never be shown.

## Engineering

### Making VS Code Trusted Types compliant

We have continued the effort to make VS Code "Trusted Types" compliant. The goal is to prevent DOM-based cross site scripting vulnerabilities. You can learn more about trusted types at the web.dev [Trusted Types site](https://web.dev/trusted-types) and follow our progress in [issue #103699](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/103699).


## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Settings sync

Settings sync now synchronizes extensions global state. Extensions shall have to provide the state to sync using the newly introduced [setKeysForSync](#Sync-Global-State) API

### Remember proxy credentials

We are overhauling the login dialog that shows when a network connection requires authentication with a proxy. A new setting `window.enableExperimentalProxyLoginDialog: true` will enable this new experience that we plan to make the default in a future release:

![Proxy Login](images/1_51/proxy-login.png)

_Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)_

The dialog will appear inside the VS Code window and offer a way to remember the credentials so that you do not have to provide the credentials each time you start VS Code. Credentials will be stored in the OS standard credential store (keychain on macOS, Windows Credential Manager on Windows and gnome keyring on Linux).

We still only show this dialog once per session but might revisit this decision in the future. You will see the dialog appear again in case the credentials you selected to be remembered are not valid. Providing them again allows you to change them.

Please enable this option and let us know if something does not work as expected through our [issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

Work continues on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues.

To learn about all the new features and updates, you can see the full [changelog for the 0.22.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0220) release of the extension.

## Extension authoring

### Codicon colors in trees

With the finalization of the [`ThemeIcon` color API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/5dbb54cab77218f8f722c49fb10dfe44fd909298/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L821-L826) extension authors can use theme colors on codicons in the custom tree views.

![Tree icon color](images/1_51/tree-icon-color.png)

### Sync Global State

Extensions can now sync their global state by providing the keys, whose values should be synchronized when Settings Sync is enabled,  using newly introduced `setKeysForSync` API in `globalState` memento.

```ts
/**
 * Set the keys whose values should be synchronized across devices when synchronizing user-data
 * like configuration, extensions, and mementos.
 *
 * Note that this function defines the whole set of keys whose values are synchronized:
 *  - calling it with an empty array stops synchronization for this memento
 *  - calling it with a non-empty array replaces all keys whose values are synchronized
 *
 * For any given set of keys this function needs to be called only once but there is no harm in
 * repeatedly calling it.
 *
 * @param keys The set of keys whose values are synced.
 */
setKeysForSync(keys: string[]): void;
```
