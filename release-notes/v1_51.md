# October 2020 (version 1.51)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.51 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/108473)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22October+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### More prominent pinned tabs

Pinned tabs will now always show their pin icon, even while inactive, to make them easier to identify. If an editor is both pinned and contains unsaved changes, the icon reflects both states.

![Inactive pinned tabs](images/1_51/pinned-tabs.png)

### Extension trees use custom hover

Instead of using the native tooltip in extension tree views, we now use a custom hover that is consistent cross-platform and fits better with the overall UX.

![Custom tree hover](images/1_51/custom-tree-hover.gif)

### Install an extension without synchronizing

You can now install an extension without synchronizing it while settings sync is enabled.

![Install extension without syncing](images/1_51/extension-install-donot-sync.png)

## Integrated Terminal

### Local Echo

Making modifications in the terminal traditionally requires information to be sent to the terminal process, processed, and returned to VS Code in order to be effected. This can be slow when working on a poor or distant connection to an [SSH server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) or [Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

This release adds a "local echo" mode to the terminal, which attempts to predict modifications and cursor movements made locally and show them in the UI without requiring a round-trip to the server. By default, predicted characters show as "dimmed":

![Gif showing typing with 250ms latency where characters entered immediately are dimmed](images/1_51/local-echo.gif)

There are two settings you can use to configure this:

- `terminal.integrated.localEchoLatencyThreshold` configures the detected delay threshold, in milliseconds, at which local echo will activate. This can be set to `0` to turn on the feature all the time, or `-1` to disable it. Defaults to `30`.
- `terminal.integrated.localEchoStyle` configures the style or color of local character, defaults to `dim`.

## IntelliSense

### Resizable suggestions

This milestone, we've made several improvements to the suggestions UI. First and foremost, it can now be resized. Drag the sides or corners to resize the control.

![Resizable Suggestions control](images/1_51/suggest-drag.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme), Font_: FiraCode*

The size of the suggestions list will be saved and restored across sessions. The size of the details pane is only saved per session, since that size tends to be more variable. Also, the `editor.suggest.maxVisibleSuggestions` setting has become obsolete.

### Status bar for suggestions

The suggestions control can now also show its own status bar at the bottom of the window. Enable it using the `editor.suggestStatusBar.enable` setting. It makes toggling details simpler, and shows if a completion supports inserting, replacing, or both.

![Suggest Status Bar](images/1_51/suggest-status.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme), Font: FiraCode*

In the sample above, selecting "Insert" results in `Math.floorceil` and selecting "Replace" results in `Math.floor`.

The new `editor.suggest.insertMode` setting allows you to configure whether you prefer insert or replace. When a suggestion supports both, your preference will be the default.

### Move cursor to select suggestions

Last but not least, you can now move the cursor while suggestions are showing. For instance, you can trigger suggestions at the end of a word, move left to see more suggestions, and then use replace to overwrite the word.

![Suggest Status Bar](images/1_51/suggest-left.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)*

## Emmet

Custom snippets in Emmet are back. Additionally, snippets now automatically refresh upon saving the snippets file or updating the `emmet.extensionsPath` setting.

![Emmet Custom Snippets Working Again](images/1_51/emmet-custom-snippets.gif)

## Source Control

### Source Control input box saves commit message history

This addresses a **[feature request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/26952)** to navigate SCM commit history. Press `kb(scm.viewPreviousCommit)` and `kb(scm.viewNextCommit)` to display the prior and next commits, respectively. To move directly to the first and last position of the input box, press `kbstyle(Alt)` in conjunction with the corresponding arrow key. You can build off of past commit messages and look back in the history without losing your drafted message.

![After typing a message in the SCM input box, then staging and committing changes, pressing the up arrow reveals the message that was just committed.](images/1_51/scm-commit-history-demo.gif)

## Languages

### Markdown smart select

Expand and shrink selection in Markdown documents using the following new commands:

* Expand: `kb(editor.action.smartSelect.expand)`
* Shrink: `kb(editor.action.smartSelect.shrink)`

Selection applies to the following, and follows a traditional hierarchical pattern:

* Headers
* Lists
* Block quotes
* Fenced code blocks
* Html code blocks
* Paragraphs

![smart select within a markdown document expands from a block element to the block element containing it to the rest of the content under a header to the header itself](images/1_51/markdown-smart-select-demo.gif)

### insertSpaceAfterOpeningAndBeforeClosingEmptyBraces formatting option for JavaScript and TypeScript

The new `javascript.format.insertSpaceAfterOpeningAndBeforeClosingEmptyBraces` and `typescript.format.insertSpaceAfterOpeningAndBeforeClosingEmptyBraces` formatting configuration option controls if spaces are inserted between empty braces. The default value for these settings is true. For example, for the JavaScript:

```js
class Foo {
    doFoo() { }
}
```

Setting `"javascript.format.insertSpaceAfterOpeningAndBeforeClosingEmptyBraces": false` and formatting the code results in:

```js
class Foo {
    doFoo() {} // Notice that the space has been removed
}
```

## Browser support

### Download folders (Edge, Chrome)

Leveraging the new [File System Access](https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/) API, VS Code running in a browser can now offer a download action for folders from the File Explorer to download all files and folders to disk.

![Download folder](images/1_51/download-folder.gif)

**Note:** This requires a recent version of Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.

### Open Workspace notification

If you open a folder that contains `.code-workspace` files at the top level, you'll now see a notification asking you to open it. This was always the case in VS Code for desktop, and will now work in the browser too.

![Workspace notification](images/1_51/open-workspace.png)

### Prevent accidental close

A new setting `window.confirmBeforeClose` was added to show a confirmation dialog before closing or leaving the workbench.

Possible values are:

* `keyboardOnly` The confirmation will only be shown when you use a keybinding to close (for example, `kb(workbench.action.closeWindow)`). (default)
* `always`: The confirmation dialog will always be shown, even if you close from a mouse gesture.
* `never`: The confirmation will never be shown.

![Close confirmation dialog](images/1_51/web-confirmation.png)

## Engineering

### Making VS Code Trusted Types compliant

We have continued the effort to make VS Code "Trusted Types" compliant. The goal is to prevent DOM-based cross site scripting vulnerabilities. You can learn more about trusted types at the web.dev [Trusted Types site](https://web.dev/trusted-types) and follow our progress in [issue #103699](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/103699).

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Settings sync

Settings sync now synchronizes extensions' global state. Extensions will have to provide the state to sync using the newly introduced [setKeysForSync](#Sync-Global-State) API.

### Remember proxy credentials

We are overhauling the login dialog that shows when a network connection requires authentication with a proxy. A new setting, `window.enableExperimentalProxyLoginDialog: true`, will enable this new experience that we plan to make the default in a future release.

![Proxy Login](images/1_51/proxy-login.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)*

The dialog will appear inside the VS Code window and offer a way to remember the credentials so that you do not have to provide them each time you start VS Code. Credentials will be stored in the OS standard credential store (keychain on macOS, Windows Credential Manager on Windows, and gnome keyring on Linux).

We still only show this dialog once per session, but might revisit this decision in the future. You will see the dialog appear again in case the credentials you selected to be remembered are not valid. Providing them again allows you to change them.

Please enable this option and let us know if something does not work as expected through our [issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).

### TypeScript 4.1 beta support

VS Code supports the [TypeScript 4.1 beta](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1-beta/) and nightly builds. The 4.1 update brings some new TypeScript language features, such as support for [recursive conditional types](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1-beta/#recursive-conditional-types), as well as tooling improvements. One focus area has been [adding initial support](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1-beta/#jsdoc-see-tag) for `@see` tags in JSDoc comments.

To start using the TypeScript 4.1 nightly builds, just install the [TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next). Please share feedback and let us know if you run into any bugs with TypeScript 4.1.

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

Work continues on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues.

To learn about all the new features and updates, you can see the full [changelog for the 0.22.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0220) release of the extension.

## Extension authoring

### Updated extension samples

We've updated some of our [extension samples](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples) to include VS Code default styles that are hooked up to our color theme tokens. This means that common elements (text, buttons, inputs) will be themeable and match the default styles in the product. Below are the extensions that include this:

* [custom-editor-sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/custom-editor-sample)
* [webview-sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/webview-sample)
* [webview-view-sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/webview-view-sample)

![Webview style samples](images/1_51/webview-styles.gif)

### Codicon colors in trees

With the finalization of the [`ThemeIcon` color API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/5dbb54cab77218f8f722c49fb10dfe44fd909298/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L821-L826) extension authors can use theme colors on codicons in custom tree views.

![Tree icon color](images/1_51/tree-icon-color.png)

### Sync Global State

Extensions can now sync their global state by providing the keys, whose values should be synchronized when Settings Sync is enabled, using the newly introduced `setKeysForSync` API in `globalState` memento.

```ts
/**
 * Set the keys whose values should be synchronized across devices when synchronizing user-data
 * like configuration, extensions, and mementos.
 *
 * Note that this function defines the whole set of keys whose values are synchronized:
 *  - calling it with an empty array stops synchronization for this memento
 *  - calling it with a non-empty array replaces all keys whose values are synchronized
 *
 * For any given set of keys this function needs to be called only once but there is no harm in
 * repeatedly calling it.
 *
 * @param keys The set of keys whose values are synced.
 */
setKeysForSync(keys: string[]): void;
```

### Comment thread reply button visibility

[Comment](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#comments) extensions can now control the visibility of the reply button in a comment thread with a new property, `CommentThread#canReply`. When it's set to `false`, users will not see the reply button or comment box in the comment thread.

## New commands

| Key                                               | Command                                       | Command ID                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `kb(workbench.action.focusLeftGroupWithoutWrap)`  | Focus Left Editor Group (do not wrap around)  | `workbench.action.focusLeftGroupWithoutWrap`  |
| `kb(workbench.action.focusRightGroupWithoutWrap)` | Focus Right Editor Group (do not wrap around) | `workbench.action.focusRightGroupWithoutWrap` |
| `kb(workbench.action.focusAboveGroupWithoutWrap)` | Focus Above Editor Group (do not wrap around) | `workbench.action.focusAboveGroupWithoutWrap` |
| `kb(workbench.action.focusBelowGroupWithoutWrap)` | Focus Below Editor Group (do not wrap around) | `workbench.action.focusBelowGroupWithoutWrap` |
| `kb(workbench.action.focusActivityBar)`           | Focus Activity Bar                            | `workbench.action.focusActivityBar`           |
