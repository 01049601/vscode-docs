## Workbench

### More Prominent Pinned Tabs

Pinned tabs will now always show their pin-icon, even if not active to make it easier to identify them. If an editor is both pinned and dirty, the icon reflects both states.

## Browser support

### Download Folders (Edge, Chrome)

Leveraging the new [File System Access](https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/) API, VSCode for Web can now offer a download action for folders from the file explorer to download all files and folders to disk.

**Note:** this requires a recent Edge or Chrome browser.

### Open Workspace Notification

If you open a folder that contains `.code-workspace` files top level, you now see a notification asking to open it. This was always the case in VSCode for desktop and will now work in web too.

### New Setting to prevent accident close

A new setting `window.confirmBeforeClose` is introduced to show a confirmation dialog before closing or leaving the workbench. Possible values are:
* `keyboardOnly` (default): the confirmation will only be shown when you use a keybinding to close (e.g. `Ctrl+W` or `Cmd+W`)
* `always`: the confirmation will always be shown, even if you close from a mouse gesture
* `never`: the confirmation will never be shown
