# October 2020 (version 1.51)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.51 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/108473)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22October+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### More prominent pinned tabs

Pinned tabs will now always show their pin-icon, even if not active to make it easier to identify them. If an editor is both pinned and dirty, the icon reflects both states.

## Emmet

Custom snippets in Emmet work again! Additionally, snippets now automatically refresh upon saving the snippets file or updating `emmet.extensionsPath`.

## Browser support

### Download folders (Edge, Chrome)

Leveraging the new [File System Access](https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/) API, VS Code running in a browser can now offer a download action for folders from the File Explorer to download all files and folders to disk.

**Note:** This requires a recent Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome browser.

### Open Workspace notification

If you open a folder that contains `.code-workspace` files top level, you now see a notification asking to open it. This was always the case in VS Code for desktop and will now work in the browser too.

### Prevent accidental close

A new setting `window.confirmBeforeClose` was added to show a confirmation dialog before closing or leaving the workbench.

Possible values are:

* `keyboardOnly` The confirmation will only be shown when you use a keybinding to close (for example `Ctrl+W` or `Cmd+W`). (default)
* `always`: The confirmation dialog will always be shown, even if you close from a mouse gesture.
* `never`: The confirmation will never be shown.

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Remember proxy credentials

We are overhauling the login dialog that shows when a network connection requires authentication with a proxy. A new setting `window.enableExperimentalProxyLoginDialog: true` will enable this new experience that we plan to make the default in a future release:

![Proxy Login](images/1_51/proxy-login.png)

_Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.github-vscode-theme)_

The dialog will appear inside the VS Code window and offer a way to remember the credentials so that you do not have to provide the credentials each time you start VS Code. Credentials will be stored in the OS standard credential store (keychain on macOS, Windows Credential Manager on Windows and gnome keyring on Linux).

We still only show this dialog once per session but might revisit this decision in the future. You will see the dialog appear again in case the credentials you selected to be remembered are not valid. Providing them again allows you to change them.

Please enable this option and let us know if something does not work as expected through our [issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).
