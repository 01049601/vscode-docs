# October 2021 (version 1.62)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.62 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/134730)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22October+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Notebooks

### Find and Replace supports capturing groups

The Find and Replace widget in the notebook editor supports capturing groups now

## Workbench

### Settings editor accessibility improvements

There were various Settings editor accessibility improvements this iteration:

- The Settings editor scrolls back to the top after performing a search, so the user does not end up midway through the search results after each search.
- The settings scope switcher is accessible by keyboard.
- Deprecated setting text blocks display an icon. Previously, the deprecated text was distinguished from the rest of the setting text only by being in a different colour.
- More UI elements within the Settings editor have the setting ID as their name.

### Verified Extension Publishers

VS Code now shows extension publishers whose domains are verified by VS Marketplace using verified indicator.

![Verified Extension Publishers](images/1_62/verified-publishers.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Light Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

Extension authors can reach out to [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com) for getting your domain verified.

### Copy multiple problems

You can now select and copy multiple problems in Problems view.

## Languages

### Emmet improvements

For multi-root workspaces, Emmet now sources snippets from all workspace folders, rather than just the first one. As a result, custom snippets from all workspace folders will be suggested when editing an applicable file in the workspace.

The extension also activates now when one tries to run any Emmet command. This change should fix an issue where some commands were not found when run from the command palette, while also keeping the activation event list more precise so that Emmet does not start up unnecessarily, such as in an empty workspace.

Additionally, the `editor.emmet.action.updateTag` command updates the placeholder with the tag to be updated.

### Configure how HTML completes attributes

There is a new setting `html.completion.attributeDefaultValue` that lets you choose how values are filled in when a HTML attribute is completed:
 * `doublequotes`: The value is placed in double quotes (default)
 * `singlequotes`: The value is placed in single quotes
 * `empty`: The value is left empty

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

Work continues on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. Check out the [changelog for the 0.32.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0320) release of the extension to see the highlights.

### Emoji support in file decorations

The [file decorations](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/9430f7848503b25ff1a629f2cb81b705e11672f5/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L6071)-API now supports emojis as badge texts.

## Engineering

### File watching changes

File watching in VS Code changes to a new library, thanks to the work of the Parcel team with their [@parcel/watcher](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/watcher). We will gradually roll out this change to all users in the upcoming weeks. Linux users will be happy to learn that the `files.watcherExclude` now applies natively so that the number of file handles VS Code needs to open for file watching can be greatly reduced.

The existing `files.legacyWatcher` setting was changed to an enumeration with these values:

* `on` - The new file watcher will never be used.
* `off` - The new file watcher will always be used.
* `default` - The new file watcher will only be used when you open multi-root workspaces (via `.code-workspace` file).

You should not notice any difference in your day to day work, but if file watching is broken for you, please report an issue.

### Progress for Electron sandbox support

As we continue to make the VS Code workbench ready for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/sandbox), we made progress on moving Node.js file services out of the workbench window into a different process. The same is true for the file watcher that no longer forks from the workbench window, but from a background process. This change is enabled by default in VS Code Insiders and will be the default in Stable for our November release.

## Notable fixes

* [130868](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/130868): Emmet suggestions list missing entries after adding custom snippets.json
* [131966](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/131966): Emmet unable to expand abbreviation with onclick attribute
* [135110](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/135110): Support different border settings for vertical or horizontal layouts, for in-group editor splitting
