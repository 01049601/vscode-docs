Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.67 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

## Workbench

### Bring back "Uncommitted Changes" to Timeline

When we introduced [Local History](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_66#_local-history) feature last month, we removed, the "Uncommitted Changes" entry from the Git timeline provider because it felt a bit redundant. However, some users see real value in this timeline entry and now you can bring it back by configuring the new `git.timeline.showUncommitted` setting accordingly.

## Engineering

### Playwright for Electron smoke tests

We have been using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for our web based smoke tests for a long time. But for our Electron based smoke tests we were still relying on our own custom solution. With the [support](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-electron) of Electron in Playwright, we were able to reuse most of our web based smoke test code and use it for our Electron smoke tests too. We are super excited to get the [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer) support to diagnose failing smoke tests post-mortem for all our smoke tests now.
