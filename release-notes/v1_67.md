# April 2022 (version 1.67)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.67 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/146672)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22April+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Confirm before quit

A new setting `window.confirmBeforeClose` can be configured to show a confirmation dialog before quitting the application.

You can either chose `keyboardOnly` to bring up the confirmation dialog when a keybinding is used or `alyways`, even when using the mouse to quit.

*Note*: the setting is not entirely new, we had supported it in VSCode for web for a long time.

### Exclude dirty editors in editor limit

A new setting `workbench.editor.limit.excludeDirty` controls if the maximum number of opened editors should exclude dirty editors for counting towards the configured limit.

### Bring back "Uncommitted Changes" to Timeline

When we introduced [Local History](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_66#_local-history) feature last month, we removed, the "Uncommitted Changes" entry from the Git timeline provider because it felt a bit redundant. However, some users see real value in this timeline entry and now you can bring it back by configuring the new `git.timeline.showUncommitted` setting accordingly.

### New editor placeholder when opening fails

When an editor fails to open, we no longer show a notification toast and reveal the previous opened editor. Instead, we show a generic placeholder with the error message and in some cases actions to resolve the error.

### Settings editor search widget filter button

The Settings editor search widget now contains a funnel button on the right side. Clicking on the button shows a list of filters that the user can apply to the search query in order to filter down the results.

### Settings editor language filter indicator

Settings editor language filters now change the scope widget text to more clearly show which language is being acted on when a language filter is applied. The screencap above shows the Markdown language filter being applied to the filtered settings.

For reference, when a language filter is applied, modifying a setting's value will modify the value of that setting for that language specifically.

## Source Control

**Expanded remote source providers API**

The Git extension API now allows extensions which register or display [remote source providers](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_45#_git) to provide richer information about remote sources.

Remote source providers can now set the description and icon for individual remote sources. Additionally, providers can optionally specify _recent_ remote sources. These are displayed at the top level in the picker for easy access and sorted by timestamp if one is provided.

The expanded API has been adopted by the built-in GitHub extension, as well as the [GitHub Repositories](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.remotehub) and [Azure Repos](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-repos) extensions in [github.dev](https://github.dev) and [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev).

## VS Code for the Web

**Open Remote Repository picker**

We now observe the `window.openFoldersInNewWindow` setting when you use the `Open Remote Repository` picker. This aligns the picker behavior with the rest of VS Code and replaces the 'Open in New Window' quick pick item button.

## Extension authoring

### Support for non-recursive workspace file watchers

In previous milestones we [had already announced](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_64#_vscodeworkspacecreatefilesystemwatcher-now-supports-any-path) that the `createFileSystemWatcher` API can be used to watch any folder on disk as long as the folder is not inside the opened workspace. We have now relaxed this restriction and allow non-recursive file watchers anywhere even inside the opened workspace. Non-recursive watchers have the advantage that configured settings for excludes (`files.watcherExclude`) do not apply so you can be sure that the file watcher will emit for the paths you subscribe to.

We are working on full support for recursive watchers with custom exclude rules for extensions, so stay tuned for more!

## Engineering

### Playwright for Electron smoke tests

We have been using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for our web based smoke tests for a long time. But for our Electron based smoke tests we were still relying on our own custom solution. With the [support](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-electron) of Electron in Playwright, we were able to reuse most of our web based smoke test code and use it for our Electron smoke tests too. We are super excited to get the [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer) support to diagnose failing smoke tests post-mortem for all our smoke tests now.
