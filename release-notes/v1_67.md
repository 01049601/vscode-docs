# April 2022 (version 1.67)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.67 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/146672)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22April+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Confirm before quit

A new setting `window.confirmBeforeClose` can be configured to show a confirmation dialog before quitting the application.

![Confirm before quit](images/1_67/confirm-quit.gif)

You can either chose `keyboardOnly` to bring up the confirmation dialog when a keybinding is used or `always`, even when using the mouse to quit.

**Note**: The setting is not entirely new and has been available in [VS Code for Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web) for some time.

### Save files after refactoring

Refactorings, like rename, often modify multiple files and make them dirty. Downlevel, external tools usually require these files to be saved and this is becoming easier with this release: There is a new setting `files.refactoring.autoSave` which defaults to `true` and it controls if files that were part of a refactoring should be saved automatically.

### Exclude dirty editors in editor limit

A new setting `workbench.editor.limit.excludeDirty` controls if the maximum number of opened editors should exclude dirty editors for counting towards the configured limit.

### Bring back "Uncommitted Changes" to Timeline

When we introduced [Local History](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_66#_local-history) feature last month, we removed the **Uncommitted Changes** entry from the Git timeline provider because it felt a bit redundant. However, some users see real value in this timeline entry and now you can bring it back by configuring the new `git.timeline.showUncommitted` setting accordingly.

### New editor placeholder when opening fails

When an editor fails to open, VS Code no longer shows a notification and reveals the previous opened editor. Instead, there is a generic placeholder with the error message and, in some cases, actions to resolve the error.

![Editor placeholder](images/1_67/editor-placeholder.gif)

### Settings editor search widget filter button

The Settings editor search control now contains a funnel button on the right side. Clicking on the button shows a list of filters that the user can apply to the search query in order to filter down the results.

![Selecting the Settings editor filter button and then applying a filter from the dropdown](images/1_67/se-filter-button.gif)

### Settings editor language filter indicator

Settings editor language filters now change the scope widget text to more clearly show which language is being acted on when a language filter is applied. The short video above shows the Markdown language filter being applied to the filtered settings.

For reference, when a language filter is applied, modifying a setting's value will modify the value of that setting for that language specifically.

### Extensions UI: Show Invalid or Incompatible Extensions

Extensions UI now shows invalid or incompatible extensions in the installed extension list with error status. For example, if your VS Code version is `1.67.0-insider` and have an extension that requires VS Code `1.68.0` version, then it will show up in the list with incompatible error status.

![Incompatible Extension](images/1_67/incompatible-extension.png)

## Settings Profile

### Import/Export Settings Profile

In this milestone we introduced **Settings Profile** that is a collection of your settings, extensions and UI customizations. If you customized VS Code, you can now export your customizations to a Settings Profile file (`mysetup.code-profile`) and save it to your computer and share it with others. Following gif shows exporting a Settings Profile from VS Code:

![Export Settings Profile](images/1_67/export-settings-profile.gif)

You can also import a Settings Profile file to restore your customizations. Following gif shows importing a Settings Profile into VS Code:

![Import Settings Profile](images/1_67/import-settings-profile.gif)

You can host your Settings Profile file in the Internet, for example save it as a public GitHub gist, and share the URL with others. One can import the Settings Profile file by providing the URL.

**Note:** At present only following UI customizations are included in the Settings Profile. More will be added in the future.
- Status bar items visibility
- Activity Bar, Bottom Panel & Side Panel items visibility and order
- Views visibility, location and order

## Editor

### Improved inline suggestions

Last month we added the ability to use ðŸ‘» ghost text for quick suggestions. Reminder: use `inline` for the `editor.quickSuggestions` setting. We have done some polish work in this area, notably trigger characters and TypeScript "complete functions with arguments" are now supported.

![Trigger characters and ghost text](images/1_67/inlineSuggest.gif)

To disable the IntelliSense widget when typing trigger characters, like `.`, use this configuration: `"editor.suggestOnTriggerCharacters": false`, enable TypeScript function call completions use `"typescript.suggest.completeFunctionCalls": true`

### Toggle Inlay Hints

Inlay hints are a great way to show additional information right with your source code. However, something you want to see the actual sources. For this the `editor.inlayHints.enabled` has been changed: in addition to `on` and `off` it new also supports `onUnlessPressed` and `offUnlessPressed`. The latter two show, respectively hide, inlay hints while `Ctrl+Alt` is being pressed and held.

## Terminal

### Find result count

When searching in the terminal, the result count and currently selected match index are now displayed in the Find control.

![Text is searched for in the terminal and the Find control is labeled match 12 of 14 to indicate that match 12 is currently selected](images/1_67/terminal-find-count.png)

### Improved Switch Active Terminal command

To aid in terminal selection with the **Terminal: Switch Active Terminal** command (`workbench.action.quickOpenTerm`), the terminal drop down now displays the current working directory.

![The Switch Active Terminal command drop down lists terminals along with their current working directory](images/1_67/terminal-quick-pick.png)

## Source Control

### Expanded remote source providers API

The Git extension API now allows extensions that register or display [remote source providers](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_45#_git) to provide richer information about remote sources.

Remote source providers can now set the description and icon for individual remote sources. Additionally, providers can optionally specify **recent** remote sources. These are displayed at the top level in the picker for easy access and sorted by timestamp if one is provided.

The expanded API has been adopted by the built-in GitHub extension, as well as the [GitHub Repositories](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.remotehub) and [Azure Repos](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-repos) extensions in [github.dev](https://github.dev) and [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev).

## Debugging

## VS Code for the Web

### Open Remote Repository picker

VS Code for the Web now respects the `window.openFoldersInNewWindow` setting when you use the **Open Remote Repository** picker. This aligns the picker behavior with the other versions of VS Code and replaces the **Open in New Window** Quick Pick item button.

## Contributions to extensions

### Java

**Inlay hints**

The Java language service included in the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) now supports [inlay hints](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_inlay-hints) to show parameter names for method signatures.

![Java file with parameter name inlay hints displayed for literal arguments, displayed for all arguments, and disabled](images/1_67/java-inlay-hints.gif)

There are three modes for Java parameter name inlay hints:

* `literals` - Enable parameter name hints only for literal arguments (default).
* `all` - Enable parameter name hints for literal and non-literal arguments.
* `none` - Disable parameter name hints.

**Lazy variable resolution**

The [Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug) extension now supports ['lazy' variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_65#_support-for-lazy-variables). This feature lets you defer the operations for an expensive variable until you explicitly expand the debugger UI to see it's value.

## Extension authoring

### Notebook Change and Save Event

We have finalized two notebook-related events:

1. `vscode.workspace.onDidSaveNotebookDocument` is an event that fires whenever a notebook has been saved
1. `vscode.workspace.onDidChangeNotebookDocument` is an event that fires whenever a notebook has been changed. That includes structural changes, like adding or remove cells, as well as cell changes, like changing output or metadata.

### Support for non-recursive workspace file watchers

In previous milestones, we [had already announced](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_64#_vscodeworkspacecreatefilesystemwatcher-now-supports-any-path) that the `createFileSystemWatcher` API can be used to watch any folder on disk as long as the folder is not inside the opened workspace. We have now relaxed this restriction and allow non-recursive file watchers anywhere even inside the opened workspace. Non-recursive watchers have the advantage that configured settings for excludes (`files.watcherExclude`) do not apply so you can be sure that the file watcher will emit for the paths you subscribe to.

We are working on full support for recursive watchers with custom exclude rules for extensions, so stay tuned for more!

### UX Guidelines

The [UX Guidelines](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/ux-guidelines) for extension authors has been redone to have it's own table of contents, where you can find best practices for using the various VS Code user interface elements. Specific topics discuss the recommended Do's and Don't when creating UI for your extensions so that they seamlessly integrate within VS Code.

## Engineering

### Playwright for Electron smoke tests

We have been using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for our web-based smoke tests for a long time. However, our Electron-based smoke tests were still relying on our own custom solution. With the [Electron support](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-electron) in Playwright, we were able to reuse most of our web-based smoke test code and use it for our Electron smoke tests too. We are excited to now use the [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer) to diagnose failing smoke tests post-mortem.

## Documentation

### Rust in VS Code

There is a new [Rust in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust) topic describing [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) support in VS Code with the [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer) extension. The rust-analyzer extension includes rich language features such as code completions, linting, refactorings, debugging, and more.
