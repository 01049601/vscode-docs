# May 2022 (version 1.68)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.68 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/149008)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22May+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Settings editor improvements

The Settings editor now shows a default value override indicator for language-specific settings. As a note, one can view language-specific settings by adding a language filter in the Settings editor search bar, and one can add such a filter either by typing it out explicitly, or by clicking the filter button on the right of the search bar, and selecting the "Language" option.

When the default value override indicator shows up, it indicates that the default value of the language-specific setting has been overridden by an extension. The indicator also indicates which extension overrode the default value.

![Settings editor default override indicator showing up for the editor wordwrap setting when there is a markdown language filter in place. The default override indicator indicates that the default value of the language-specific setting was overridden by the Markdown Language Features extension](images/1_68/settings-editor-language-specific-default.gif)

This iteration also fixes a behaviour where some links in the Settings editor were not redirecting properly when there was already a search query in the Settings editor search bar. The links also now have proper styling so that it is more clear when one is hovering over them.

![After searching for the word "font" in the Settings editor, and selecting the terminal category in the table of contents, the setting terminal.integrated.fontFamily shows up, and its description contains a link to the editor.fontFamily setting. Clicking on the link now brings you correctly to the setting.](images/1_68/settings-editor-working-links.gif)

### Hide files in explorer based on `.gitignore`

The file explorer now supports parsing and hiding files which are excluded by your `.gitignore` file. This can be enabled via the `explorer.excludeGitIgnore` setting. This setting works alongside `files.exclude` to hide unwanted files from the explorer. **Note**: At this time negated globs such as `!package.json` are not parseable.

### Lock hovers to more easily mouse over them

Some custom hovers cannot be moused over and others are tricky to mouse over without hiding it because of other things in the way (eg. like a scroll bar). Holding alt while a hover is active will now "lock" it, giving it a wider border and preventing moving the mouse outside of the hover widget or whatever triggered it from hiding it. This is primarily an accessibility feature to make hovers play nice with screen magnifiers but it is also useful for copying text from certain hovers. Note that this feature only applies outside of the editor because editor hovers can always be moused over unless specified otherwise via a setting.

![Holding alt while hovering an item in the extension view will add a 2 pixel border around it and allow mousing over it and selecting text](images/1_68/hover-lock.png)

## Terminal

### Find match background support

Since last release find in the terminal would show a border around all matches, this was a temporary solution until support for changing the background of cells dynamically was possible. Background is now the default for themes and the overall experience should look very similar to the editor now.

![Find now uses the blue from the editor's find for the active match and the orange for highlights](images/1_68/terminal-find-bg.png)

If you're a theme author that adopted `terminal.findMatchBorder` or `terminal.findMatchHighlightBorder` we recommend migrating to `terminal.findMatchBackground` and `terminal.findMatchHighlightBackground` if that would fit the theme better or help contrast.

### Improvements to contrast and the minimum contrast ratio feature

The find match background work added a lot more flexibility in how the terminal works with background and foreground colors. Because of this, a lot of improvements were made around contrast in the terminal, aligning the terminal visuals closer to the editor and to the minimum contrast ratio feature which changes the foreground of text dynamically to help with visibility.

- Luminance will now go in the other direction if contrast isn't met. For example if contrast isn't met for dark grey text on a lighter grey background with pure black (#000000), the color will also try move towards white and the one that best meets the desired contrast ratio will be used.
  TODO:Daniel image
- Selection is now drawn below the text when GPU acceleration is disabled and supports opaque colors, previous this had to be partially transparent and it would wash out the foreground color.
  TODO:Daniel image
- Nerd font symbols should now apply minimum contrast ratio to blend in with nearby text.
  TODO:Daniel image
- Powerline symbols and box drawing characters will _not_ apply minimum contrast ratio as they are often adjacent to inverted cells without any foreground characters.
  TODO:Daniel image
- Themes can now specify a fixed selection foreground color, this is used by default in the high contrast themes.
  TODO:Daniel image
- Several bugs were fixed to make the resulting foreground color more correct.

As a reminder, minimum contrast ratio can be disabled if you would prefer original colors by setting `"terminal.integrated.minimumContrastRatio": 1`.

## Development Container Specification

Our development container teams across Microsoft and GitHub continue active development on the new [Dev Container Specification](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec), and this iteration had several exciting highlights.

### Reference Implementation

We released an open source command-line interface (CLI) as the reference implementation for the specification. The CLI builds and starts a dev container from a `devcontainer.json`, and it can either be used directly or integrated into product experiences.

The CLI is available in a new [devcontainers/cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) repository. You can learn how to get started in [its readme](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli#try-it-out), and read more in [this blog post](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/05/18/dev-container-cli).

The CLI is under active development and will continue evolving to better support more scenarios, such as greater support for individual users. We'd love to hear your feedback along the way, so we've [opened an issue](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli/issues/7) specifically for feedback on the CLI and welcome additional issues and PRs in the repo.

### Specification

Active development continues on the specification, and we've published an [initial version](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/blob/main/docs/specs/devcontainer-reference.md) in the [devcontainers/spec](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec) repo.

As with the CLI, stay tuned for further updates and progress, and we'd love to hear your feedback.

## Contributions to extensions

### Jupyter

**Web extension**

We've made progress on supporting more of the core functionality in the new web version of the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension.

This month we ported the following features to the web extension:

* https support
* kernel completions
* ipywidgets
* notebook debugging
* variable viewing
* exporting
* interactive window

If you'd like to experiment with the functionality, launch Jupyter from your local machine with:

```bash
jupyter notebook --no-browser --NotebookApp.allow_origin_pat=https://.*\.vscode-cdn\.net
```

And connect to it using the command **Jupyter: Specify Jupyter server for connections** from within vscode.dev.

For more information (and to comment), see this discussion [item](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/discussions/10315).
