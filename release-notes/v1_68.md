Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.68 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/149008)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.

## Workbench

### Settings editor improvements

The Settings editor now shows a default value override indicator for language-specific settings. As a note, one can view language-specific settings by adding a language filter in the Settings editor search bar, and one can add such a filter either by typing it out explicitly, or by clicking the filter button on the right of the search bar, and selecting the "Language" option.

When the default value override indicator shows up, it indicates that the default value of the language-specific setting has been overridden by an extension. The indicator also indicates which extension overrode the default value.

![Settings editor default override indicator showing up for the editor wordwrap setting when there is a markdown language filter in place.

This iteration also fixes a behaviour where some links in the Settings editor were not redirecting properly when there was already a search query in the Settings editor search bar. The links also now have proper styling so that it is more clear when one is hovering over them.

![After searching for the word "font" in the Settings editor, and selecting the terminal category in the table of contents, the setting terminal.integrated.fontFamily shows up, and its description contains a link to the editor.fontFamily setting. Clicking on the link now brings you correctly to the setting.](images/1_68/settings-editor-working-links.gif)

## Notable fixes

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
