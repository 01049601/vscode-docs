# January 2022 (version 1.64)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.64 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/139607)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22January+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Settings editor

The Settings editor search now looks for string value matches in string and enum settings when searching.

![Settings editor pulling up results where the enum value matches the query](images/1_64/settings-editor-search-by-value.png)

The new search algorithm also prioritizes whole word matches, which means that if one has both the Java and JavaScript extensions, the Java settings will show up first when searching "java".

Setting enum dropdowns also now work with touchscreen devices.

## Extension authoring

### `vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher` supports any path now

The existing `vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher` API was improved to allowing you to pass in any file or folder path for file watching that is outside of the workspace. Previously the file watcher was limited to the opened folders in the workspace.

Depending on the glob pattern you pass into the method, the watcher will either be recursive (e.g. `**/*.js`) or non-recursive (`*.js`). Recursive watchers require more resources, so we recommend to use simple glob patterns only if possible.

Example:
```ts
// Watch a folder non-recursively
vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.Uri.file(<path to folder outside workspace>), '*.js'));

// Watch the active text editor file
vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri, '*'));
```

**Note:** as part of this change, we pushed a behavioural change for existing file watchers. A file watcher that is instructed with just a glob pattern (e.g. `vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher('**')`) will no longer receive events for files that changed outside of the workspace. It will only receive file events from paths that are inside the workspace. If the user has opened no workspace, no event will be delivered via this method anymore. This was done to ensure that extensions do not receive unexpected events from outside the workspace.


### Cancellation token for onWill-events

The API exposes events to participate in file operations, like [`onWillRenameFiles`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/f30dba54302d2c00356e90604ec27aceeeb38bb5/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L11375). This partcipation can be long-running and therefore users can cancel it. With this release  user-side cancellation can be observed by extensions via a cancellation token on the corresponding event, for example [`FileWillRenameEvent#token`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/f30dba54302d2c00356e90604ec27aceeeb38bb5/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L10738). This allows extension to cancel expensive downlevel operations as well.

## Engineering

### `vscode-bisect` tool

A new tool for bisecting released VSCode insider versions (web and desktop) is out to help diagnose issues:

```sh
npx vscode-bisect
```

Similar to what `git bisect` offers, `vscode-bisect` will launch a range of released insider builds from the past asking whether the build reproduces the issue or not. The end result is a range of commits that introduced the issue. The instance will use a dedicated fresh folder for user data to not impact your main development environment.
