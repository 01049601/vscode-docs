# January 2022 (version 1.64)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.64 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/139607)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22January+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Settings editor

The Settings editor search now looks for string value matches in string and enum settings when searching.

![Settings editor pulling up results where the enum value matches the query](images/1_64/settings-editor-search-by-value.png)

The new search algorithm also prioritizes whole word matches, which means that if one has both the Java and JavaScript extensions, the Java settings will show up first when searching "java".

![Settings editor search showing Java results before JavaScript ones when searching "java"](images/1_64/settings-editor-search-java-first.png)

Lastly, dropdowns (such as for `files.autoSave`) and list widgets (such as for `files.associations`) in the Settings editor now work with touchscreen devices.

### Settings Sync

Settings Sync now supports synchronizing User Tasks.

![Settings Sync User Tasks](images/1_64/settings-sync-user-tasks.png)

The default Settings Sync machine names now include the product and browser names in VS Code for the Web.

![Settings Sync default machine name](images/1_64/settings-sync-machines.png)

## Terminal

### Automatic replies

The terminal is now able to automatically reply when a specific sequence of characters is received. A good example of where this is useful, which is also the only default case, is the Windows batch script message `Terminate batch job (Y/N)?` after hitting `Ctrl+C` when running a batch script. This typically just ends up causing problems for the user. The terminal will now automatically reply with `Y` and enter (`\r`) which makes `Ctrl+C` in Windows feel much better.

![Pressing ctrl+c will immediately reply to the question and return to the prompt](images/1_64/terminal-auto-reply.gif)

*Theme: [Sapphire](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire)*

The feature was made generically so you can set up custom replies for other things, just be careful when doing this as you are sending text to the process automatically. For example, you could use it to automatically update Oh My Zsh when prompted:

```json
"terminal.integrated.autoReplies": {
  "[Oh My Zsh] Would you like to check for updates? [Y/n]": "Y\r"
}
```

If you use [Clink](https://mridgers.github.io/clink/) and enable their similar feature, you can disable it in Clink or in VS Code by setting the reply to `null` to avoid the two features conflicting with each other:

```json
"terminal.integrated.autoReplies": {
  "Terminate batch job (Y/N)": null
}
```

### Enhanced VT support

Support for OSC 4/10/11/12 escape sequences were added that enables applications to control the terminal's theme colors.

### Keyboard navigable links

Previously, link navigation in the terminal required the use of a mouse. Now, links can be opened using only the keyboard via the following commands:

* **Terminal: Open Detected Link...** to view all links (web, file, word)
* **Terminal: Open Last Web Link...** for example, `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode`
* **Terminal: Open Last File Link..** for example, `/Users/user/repo/file.txt`

## Notebooks

### Find text in rendered Markdown and code cell outputs

VS Code now supports find text in the rendered view of Markdown cells and output of code cells. They are disabled by default as they would require rendering of all Markdown cells and outputs, which might be costly on file opening. You can turn this feature on by choosing options from the filter on the Find control input box.

![Notebook find in markup and outputs](images/1_64/notebook-find-in-markup-output.gif)

### Cell collapsing UI

Notebook cells have a blue bar on the left side to indicate that they are focused. This bar is now interactive - you can click the top part to collapse the cell input, and the bottom part to collapse the output.

![Cell collapse UI](./images/1_64/collapse-gutter.gif)

### Markdown cell fold hint

<!-- TODO: roblourens -->

### Cell execution hints

### Surround with Snippets for JS/TS

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Extensions

In this milestone, we improved Marketplace interactions by minimizing the number of queries VS Code makes to the service.

## VS Code for the Web

### Remote Repositories

**GitHub Repositories**

Commits created in VS Code for the Web are now signed and marked as **Verified** in the GitHub UI. Additionally, maintainers can now commit to pull requests submitted from forks when using VS Code for the Web. This is thanks to the new GitHub GraphQL [createCommitOnBranch](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-13-a-simpler-api-for-authoring-commits/) API.

![Make verified commits and commit to pull requests from forks in VS Code for the Web](images/1_64/github-commit-signing-prs.gif)

Additionally, the Source Control view now supports [multiple selection](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/scm-provider#menus).

![Stage selected changes with a single click](images/1_64/remotehub-scm-multiple-selection.gif)

_Theme: [One Monokai](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azemoh.one-monokai)_

Previously, creating empty commits was only supported after cloning your GitHub repository to a local or remote machine. You can now also create empty commits in VS Code for the Web using the **GitHub Repositories: Commit Empty** command.

**Azure Repos**

Azure Repos support has moved out of the GitHub Repositories extension into its own dedicated [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-repos) that can also be installed on desktop.

## Contributions to extensions

### Python

**Improved interpreter Quick Pick**

In order to make it easier to select the desired interpreter, the Python extension now groups interpreters in the interpreter picker.

![Interpreters grouped in interpreter picker](images/1_64/interpreter_picker.png)

Note we're also experimenting with moving the active/selected interpreter in the Status bar towards the right possibly inside the language status, so check out the **Python** status in the right side in case it isn't visible.

**Smart selection and better folding support**

Improvements were also made for Python code selection and folding via [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance).

Selecting Python code using the keyboard takes fewer steps as the semantic information of your code is taken into account when defining the selection range:

![Expanding and shrinking Python code with Shift+Alt+RightArrow and Shift_Alt+LeftArrow](images/1_64/python-smart-selection.gif)

*Theme: [Horizon Extended](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LanceWilhelm.horizon-extended)*

As for folding, previously the regions were defined just by indentation, which was not ideal for some cases, for example, with multi-line strings. Now folding regions take into account semantic information appropriately, and also supports #region comments:

![Collapsing and expanding folding regions in Python code](images/1_64/python-folding.gif)

### Remote Development

Work continues on the [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), which allow you to use a container, remote machine, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_64.md).

## Preview features

### Terminal shell integration

The terminal now features experimental opt-in shell integration that allows VS Code to gain insights on what is going on within the terminal, which was previously a black box. When enabled using the setting `"terminal.integrated.enableShellIntegration": true`, arguments to run a shell integration script will be injected into your terminal profile if possible. The script itself mostly injects invisible sequences into your prompt, providing VS Code with information such as the location of the prompt, command, and command output, what the current working directory (cwd) is for each command, and the exit code of each command.

Using this information we can enhance existing features in various ways:

* Detect the cwd very quickly, previously this was only possible on macOS and Linux and would launch processes or query the file system to get that information. Now this also works on Windows. The cwd is used in features like link detection and inheriting the cwd when splitting a terminal tab.
* Improve the command tracking feature. This feature existed beforehand but only had default keybindings on macOS (`Cmd+Up/Down`) and used a naive approach to guess where lines were based on when `Enter` was pressed.

Shell integration enables the following new features:

* Run recent command: Since we know what commands are run, we have exposed a command that allows you to view and run them again in a Quick Pick.
  ![Recent commands are displayed in a Quick Pick, including information about current working directory and how long ago they were run](./images/1_64/terminal-recent-command.png)
* Go to recent directory: Similar to the above, we also allow navigating to past directories.
  ![Recent directories are displayed in a Quick Pick, ordered by frequency (descending)](./images/1_64/terminal-recent-directory.png)
* Link support relative to the cwd - since we know the cwd for each line in the terminal buffer, we can support opening links in the terminal relative to the cwd at the location where it was activated. Before, when a link was clicked, a Quick Pick would open with results from any folders containing a match for that name. Now, the exact file match will be opened. ![in a terminal with a cwd of vscode, package.json is echoed. Clicking on the file name will result in vscode/package.json opening. The directory is changed to be the template-string-converter and then package.json is echoed. Clicking on the file name will open template-string-converter/package.json.](./images/1_64/relative-cwd-link.png)

The goal is to turn shell integration on by default when reliability of the feature is good. The approach we're taking with regard to argument injection is to be as unintrusive as possible. For example, we do not modify your shell initialization scripts automatically like some terminals but instead intercept the creation of the process, inspect the arguments and inject shell integration arguments if we are confident the terminal can run with them. The hope is to make it work well without any configuration required by the user, and to not interfere with your existing shell settings.

The current shells supported are pwsh for Windows and pwsh, bash, and zsh for Linux and macOS.

As mentioned previously this is an experimental feature that is a little rough around the edges, here are some known issues:

* `$PS2` line continuations aren't supported yet, line continuations do work in pwsh though.
* Right prompts aren't supported yet.
* The zsh script is known to [not activate sometimes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/141620).
* Remote VS Code window support is limited.

## Extension authoring

### QuickPickItem separators

Extension authors now have the ability to add separators to a Quick Pick. This is useful for grouping items or just having a bit of space between items:

![Quick Pick separators](images/1_64/quickpick-separators.png)

To add a separator to your existing Quick Pick, you can add a new `QuickPickItem` to your existing list of items but specify the `kind` property on the `QuickPickItem` and set it to `QuickPickItemKind.Separator`.

In the example above, you would add the following object to your list of items:

```ts
{
    label: 'APIs',
    kind: QuickPickItemKind.Separator
}
```

If you don't specify a `kind` property, or you set it to `QuickPickItemKind.Default`, the item will be treated as a normal `QuickPickItem`.

### vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher now supports any path

The existing `vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher` API was improved to allow you to pass in any file or folder path for file watching that is outside of the workspace. Previously, the file watcher was limited to the opened folders in the workspace.

Depending on the glob pattern you pass into the method, the watcher will either be recursive (for example, `**/*.js`) or non-recursive (`*.js`). Recursive watchers require more resources, so we recommend using simple glob patterns if possible.

Example:

```ts
// Watch a folder non-recursively
vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.Uri.file(<path to folder outside workspace>), '*.js'));

// Watch the active text editor file
vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri, '*'));
```

**Note:** As part of this change, we pushed a behavioral change for existing file watchers. A file watcher that is instructed with just a glob pattern (for example, `vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher('**')`) will no longer receive events for files that changed outside of the workspace. It will only receive file events from paths that are inside the workspace. If the user has opened no workspace, no event will be delivered via this method anymore. This was done to ensure that extensions do not receive unexpected events from outside the workspace.

### vscode.TerminalLocation

Specify where an extension terminal will be created with the new [TerminalLocation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/1a57cb85407249f380f0ebfb34c748a960e5430a/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L9807) API.

This enables creating a split terminal by providing a [parentTerminal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/1a57cb85407249f380f0ebfb34c748a960e5430a/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L6012), choosing between the [editor area and the panel](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/1a57cb85407249f380f0ebfb34c748a960e5430a/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L5978), and more.

### Cancellation token for onWill events

The API exposes events to participate in file operations, like [onWillRenameFiles](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/f30dba54302d2c00356e90604ec27aceeeb38bb5/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L11375). This participation can be long-running and therefore users can cancel it. With this release, user-side cancellation can be observed by extensions via a cancellation token on the corresponding event, for example [FileWillRenameEvent#token](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/f30dba54302d2c00356e90604ec27aceeeb38bb5/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L10738). This allows extensions to cancel expensive downlevel operations as well.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Disable terminal persistence

When creating a terminal, opt-out of terminal persistence on restart and reload by setting `disablePersistence` in `TerminalOptions` or `ExtensionTerminalOptions`.

```ts
export interface TerminalOptions {
    disablePersistence?: boolean;
}
```

### Inlay hint API is nearing its completion

This is a shout to everyone who's interested in the inlay hints API. It is nearing completion and has added support for interactive label parts. Those allow you to bind a source code location to hints that in return enables features like code navigation. Also, commands are now supported. The latest state and development of this proposal is here: [vscode.proposed.inlayHints.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.inlayHints.d.ts)

### Language status API is nearing its completion

The language status item API is planned for finalization. Please try it out and provide feedback for [vscode.proposed.languageStatus.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.languageStatus.d.ts).

## Engineering

### vscode-bisect tool

A new tool for bisecting released VS Code Insiders versions (web and desktop) is available to help diagnose issues:

```sh
npx vscode-bisect
```

![VS Code bisect tool](images/1_64/vscode-bisect.gif)

Similar to `git bisect`, `vscode-bisect` will launch a range of released Insiders builds from the past asking whether the build reproduces the issue or not. The end result is a range of commits that introduced the issue. The instance will use a dedicated fresh folder for user data to not impact your main development environment.

## Notable fixes
