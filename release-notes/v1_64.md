## Engineering

### `vscode-bisect` tool

A new tool for bisecting released VSCode insider versions (web and desktop) is out to help diagnose issues:

```sh
npx vscode-bisect
```

Similar to what `git bisect` offers, `vscode-bisect` will launch a range of released insider builds from the past asking whether the build reproduces the issue or not. The end result is a range of commits that introduced the issue. The instance will use a dedicated fresh folder for user data to not impact your main development environment.
