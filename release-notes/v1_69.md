# June 2022 (version 1.69)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.69 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22June+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Settings editor indicator area changes and language overrides

The Settings editor now shows when a setting has a language override. For context, language overrides always take precedence over non-language-specific overrides, so if the value of a setting doesn't seem to affect the behaviour of the setting for a certain type of file, it could be that the setting has a language override.

The indicator text has changed a bit in general to be more clear and concise. The screencap below shows the new Modified elsewhere indicator. Hovering over the indicator reveals a custom hover that shows language overrides, when applicable. The screencap later shows the new default override indicator with the text "Default value changed".

### Command Center

The command center has been polished and is now ready to be tried. Enable it via `window.commandCenter`-setting.

## Debugging

### Unbound breakpoint warning icon in Javascript debugging

If you are debugging a TS/JS project and having trouble configuring sourcemaps or getting your breakpoints to bind, we will now show a hint message in the breakpoints view with a link for the Javascript debugger's breakpoint troubleshooting tool. You will also see the hint when hovering the gray breakpoint icon in the editor.

When the API to show this hint is finalized, other debuggers will be able to show the hint with their own appropriate message.
