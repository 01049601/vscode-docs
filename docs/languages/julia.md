Most of these features just work out of the box, while some may require basic configuration to get the best experience. This page summarizes the Julia features that VS Code ships with. For a more in-depth guide on how these features work and can be configured, see [The Julia VSCode Docs](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/).
