# Spring Boot in Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an ideal lightweight development environment for Spring Boot application developers and there are several useful VS Code extensions including:

* [Spring Boot Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-spring-boot)
* [Spring Initializr](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr)
* [Spring Boot Dashboard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-boot-dashboard)

If you run into any issues when using the features below, you can contact us by entering an [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/issues).

## Prerequisites

A working Java environment with essential extensions installed is needed, including:

* [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)
* [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
* [Spring Boot Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pivotal.vscode-boot-dev-pack)

<a class="tutorial-install-extension-btn" href="vscode:extension/pivotal.vscode-boot-dev-pack">Install the Spring Boot Extension Pack</a>

For more details, refer to the [Getting Started with Java](/docs/java/java-tutorial.md#setting-up-vs-code-for-java-development) tutorial.

>**Note**: More information about JDK can be found at [supported Java versions](/docs/java/java-tutorial.md#supported-java-versions).

## Create the project

The [Spring Initializr](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr) extension allows you to search for dependencies and generate new Spring Boot projects.

To install, launch VS Code and from the Extensions view (`kb(workbench.view.extensions)`), search for `vscode-spring-initializr`.

Once you have the extension installed, open the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`) and type `Spring Initializr` to start generating a Maven or Gradle project and then follow the wizard.

## Edit the project

The [Spring Initializr](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr) extension allows you to add dependencies after generating a new Spring Boot project.

Navigate to your `pom.xml` file and right-click to select **Add starters...**. A dropdown will show the dependencies you already have beginning with a `âˆš` . You can search for other dependencies you want to add to your project. Or you can click on the existing dependencies to remove them.

## Develop the application

The [Spring Boot Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-spring-boot) extension includes rich language support for working with Spring Boot `application.properties`, `application.yml`, and `.java` files.

The extension supports quick navigate through source code, smart code completions, quick access to running apps, live application information, and code templates. Similar code completion and validation features are also available for `.properties` and `.yml` files. You  can learn more
in the [VS Code Language Server for Spring Boot README](https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/tree/main/vscode-extensions/vscode-spring-boot#usage).

Below is an example showing live application information.

## Run the application

In addition to using `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` to run your application, there's the [Spring Boot Dashboard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-boot-dashboard) extension, which lets you view and manage all available Spring Boot projects in your workspace as well as quickly start, stop, or debug your project.
