# Making Remote Development Even Better

December 07, 2022 by Brigit Murtaugh, [@BrigitMurtaugh](https://twitter.com/BrigitMurtaugh)

At its core, Visual Studio Code is a code editor, and it integrates with other environments through our [remote development experiences](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) to become even more powerful and flexible:

You may not think about it, but VS Code has a [CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line) (command line interface) built-in that lets you control how you launch the editor - you can open files, install extensions, and output diagnostics through command-line options:

![Output of code CLI](./tunneling-blog-code-help-new.png)

The CLI is incredibly useful in workflows using VS Code Desktop, but there was a gap: you couldn't start a remote instance with it. So, we wanted to fix that gap by bringing local and remote closer together to make the CLI even more powerful.

Today, we're thrilled to share our enhanced `code` CLI that lets you both launch VS Code and connect to the machine remotely from VS Code Desktop or vscode.dev. The updated CLI is built-in to the latest VS Code release and also now available for standalone install, so you can create a secure connection to any computer and connect to it remotely, even if you can't install VS Code Desktop on it.

Along with the CLI, we've made the following updates to improve remote development:
* You can enable tunneling directly from the VS Code UI
* Tunneling is no longer in private preview â€“ anyone can create and use tunnels, no signup required
* We continue improving our Remote Development Extensions - we renamed Remote-WSL to [WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl), and Remote-Containers to [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers), to be clearer about how they work and help users leverage them even more effectively

## Tunnel to anywhere, from one tool

Tunneling, also known as port forwarding, securely transmits data from one network to another. You can use secure tunnels to develop against any machine of your choosing in a VS Code desktop or web client, without the hassle of setting up SSH or https (although you can do that if you want as well ðŸ˜Š).

You have two great options for tunneling to remote machines from VS Code:
* Use the new, enhanced `code` CLI
* Enable tunneling from the VS Code UI directly

Weâ€™ll explore both options in the following sections.

### Enhanced `code` CLI

When we released the VS Code Server, we [mentioned](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/07/07/vscode-server#_a-preview-of-a-larger-journey) our long-term vision to integrate it into the [`code` CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line). Weâ€™ve now achieved this, and weâ€™ve also made it available for standalone install, in case youâ€™re working on a VM or locked down machine where you canâ€™t install VS Code Desktop.

Below are the steps to install the `code` CLI and create a secure tunnel with it. If you tried the private preview of the VS Code Server, the steps will be very similar.

1. Install the `code` CLI on a remote machine you'd like to develop against in a local VS Code client. This could be a remote desktop, VM, or even a [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) (WSL) distro.

    The CLI is automatically included in your existing VS Code installation â€“ no additional setup required. If you don't have VS Code installed or can't install it on your remote machine, you can grab the CLI through a [standalone install](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) on our download page:

    ![CLI download section](./tunneling-blog-download.png)

2. Double-check the CLI installed successfully by using the help command:

    ```bash
    code -h
    ```

    You may explore tunneling-specific commands with:

    ```bash
    code tunnel -h
    ```

    Now that you've installed the CLI, let's set up this machine for tunneling so that you can connect to it from any VS Code client.

3. Create a secure tunnel with the `tunnel` command:

    ```bash
    code tunnel
    ```

    This command downloads and starts the VS Code Server on this machine and then creates a tunnel to it.

4. This CLI will output a vscode.dev URL tied to this remote machine, such as `https://vscode.dev/tunnel/<machine_name>/<folder_name>`. You can open this URL on a machine of your choosing.

5. If opening a vscode.dev URL for the first time on this client, you'll be prompted to log into your GitHub account at a `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize...` URL. This authenticates you to the tunneling service to ensure you have access to the right set of remote machines.

Congratulations, you've successfully installed and used the latest tunneling features of the `code` CLI!

### Enable Tunneling from VS Code UI

You may also choose to facilitate tunnels directly from the VS Code UI if you have VS Code installed on your remote machine. This is a quick, convenient way to enable remote access to your machine if you're already working in VS Code.

Open VS Code on your remote machine. In the VS Code Account menu, select the option to **Turn on Remote Tunnel Accessâ€¦**, as demonstrated in the image below. You may also open the Command Palette (`F1`) and run the command **Remote Tunnels: Turn on Remote Tunnel Access...**.

![Turn on Remote Tunnel Access in the Account menu](./tunneling-blog-access-red.png)

You'll be prompted to log into GitHub. Once logged in, a tunnel will start up on this remote machine, and you'll be able to connect to it:

In a client of your choice, you can open the vscode.dev link from the notification above and start coding!

### Connect via Remote Tunnels

The [Remote Tunnels extension](https://aka.ms/remote-tunnels-doc) facilitates these secure tunnels between your local and remote machines. The vscode.dev instances you open through the `code` CLI or VS Code UI come with the Remote Tunnels extension preinstalled.

If you're already working in a VS Code client (desktop or web) and would like to connect to a remote tunnel, you can install and use the [Remote Tunnels](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-server) extension directly. Once you install the extension, open the Command Palette (`F1`) and run the command **Remote Tunnels: Connect to Tunnel**. Youâ€™ll be able to connect to any remote machines with an active tunnel:

You can also view your remote machines in the Remote Explorer, which you can open through the command **Remote Explorer: Focus on Remote View**:

### Removing a tunnel or machine

If you'd like to stop a tunnel you're running via the CLI, you may use `Ctrl + C` to end the active connection. If you've enabled tunneling through the VS Code UI, you may run the command **Remote Tunnels: Turn of Remote Tunnel Access...**.

You may remove a machine's association with tunneling by running `code tunnel unregister` on that machine. You may also open any VS Code client, select the Remote Explorer view, right-click on the machine youâ€™d like to remove, and select "unregister."

## Remote Development Extensions

Along with the updates to tunneling and the `code` CLI, weâ€™ve made some updates to our [Remote Development Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview), which allow you to use a development container, remote machine, or WSL as a full-featured development environment.

### WSL and Dev Containers

We've heard your feedback about the names of the **Remote - WSL** and **Remote - Containers** extensions. We intended for `Remote` to indicate you develop in a "remote" or "separate" WSL distro or development container, rather than traditional local development. However, this is a different use of "remote" than many people use, and it can cause confusion (for example, is the dev container on my local machine?).

We've updated naming and in-product commands in these extensions to be clearer, renaming them to [**WSL**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) and [**Dev Containers**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). Links such as the extension identifier in the Marketplace and documentation remain the same, so you shouldn't see breakage in your current use of these two extensions.

### Remote Tunnels

As described in the getting started above, you can use the [Remote Tunnels](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-server) extension to connect to a remote machine via a secure tunnel, without the requirement of SSH. Weâ€™ve renamed the extension to "Remote Tunnels" from "Remote Server" as we believe this more clearly indicates its behavior (the extension is used to develop on remote machines via secure tunnels after all!).

## Closing â€“ thank you!

Weâ€™ve heard your feedback over the years on our remote experiences and most recently on the VS Code Server â€“ we can't thank you enough for sharing the thoughts that continue to shape our product experiences. We're excited to see how you use our latest remote features and for your feedback!

If youâ€™d like a more in-depth look at the tools described in this blog, we created a [doc](https://aka.ms/remote-tunnels-doc) on the Remote Tunnels extension, along with updating the [VS Code Server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server) and [`code` CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line) docs to reflect the latest changes.

Please feel free to file feature requests or bugs in our [vscode-remote-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues) GitHub repository, or you can Tweet us your thoughts [@Code](https://twitter.com/code).

Happy Coding!
