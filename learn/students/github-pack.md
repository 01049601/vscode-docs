# GitHub Student Developer Pack

Welcome to Visual Studio Code! VS Code is a free coding editor that helps you start coding quickly. Use it to code in any programming language, without switching editors. VS Code comes with built-in source control, so you can compare versions of your code side-by-side and save your work over time by backing it up on [GitHub](https://github.com). We have resources specifically created for students and educators, including our [Python and Java Coding Packs](https://code.visualstudio.com/learntocode), programming lessons built in partnership with [NASA](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/students/nasa-python) and [Netflix](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/students/spacejam-python), and [videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics) to quickly get up to speed.
