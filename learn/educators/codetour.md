# CodeTour

## What is CodeTour?

[CodeTour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to create a step-by-step guide through your codebases. This can be helpful in your classroom to break up your assignments into steps for students to follow or to get them familiar with all parts of the assignment by pointing them to relevant pieces within the assignment.

Essentially, a "code tour" is simply a series of interactive steps, each of which are associated with a specific directory, or file/line, and include a description of the respective code. Tours can either be checked into a repo to share with source control, or exported to a "tour file", which allows anyone to replay the same tour, without having to clone any code!

## Case study

We've used CodeTour in the Microsoft partnered Space Jam lessons: [Use basketball stats to optimize game play with Visual Studio Code, inspired by SPACE JAM: A NEW LEGACY](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/optimize-basketball-games-with-machine-learning)

CodeTour helps guide the self-paced learners through [module 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/optimize-basketball-player-rest-breaks), where they are [creating a web app](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/optimize-basketball-player-rest-breaks/7-codetour) that uses basketball stats to make decisions on the basketball court.
