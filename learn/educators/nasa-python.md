This learning path introduces you to the world of Python. But the goal is not to learn Python, the goal is to understand how Python plays a role in the innovative solutions that NASA creates. Through the lens of space discovery, this learning path could ignite a passion to persistently learn, discover, and create so that you too can one day help us all understand a little more about the world beyond our Earth.

Through these modules, you will:

* Understand and install the tools needed to learn programming
* Learn core programming concepts and apply them to real-life NASA problems
* Gain knowledge about cutting-edge technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence
* See actual NASA employees talk about their job and give advice
