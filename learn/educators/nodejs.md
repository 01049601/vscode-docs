# Node.js and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code
TODO
Visual Studio Code is a free code editor that fully supports Python and useful features such as real-time collaboration. It's highly customizable to support your classroom the way you like to teach.

> "Visual Studio Code is the best balance of authenticity and accessibility... Visual Studio Code doesn't feel 'fake', it's what real software developers use. Plus, Visual Studio Code works on every OS!" - Professor Zachary Dodds from Harvey Mudd College

Read below for recommendations for extensions, settings, and links to free lessons that you can use in your classes.

## Intro to Web Development at Naresuan University

[Charles Allen](https://th.linkedin.com/in/ajahncharles) is a lecturer at [Naresuan University](https://www.nu.ac.th/) in Thailand and teaches several Computer Science and Business courses. He teaches a project-based Web Development course where students build a TypeScript app using the Vue.js framework and Firebase.

### Why Visual Studio Code?

Charles has been using Visual Studio Code to teach for the past 4 years since he inherited the class. In his own words:

> "The more realistic the learning environment, the more comprehensive the education. I am not just teaching code; I'm also teaching the tools, tactics, and teamwork my students will need to start building for themselves. VS Code is the first choice of web professionals, so itâ€™s the first choice for my class!"

In 2019, [StackOverFlow found VS Code to be the most popular editor](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools) amongst their community.

### Portable setup

VS Code is great for Charles because the lab machines on which students work get wiped everyday per school policy. But since VS Code has a [portable mode](/docs/editor/portable), which stores all its app data in one spot to run from a single directory, he can quickly add his configured VS Code to every lab machine. To do this, he gives their IT technician an image (a template for setting up an environment) which has a portable version of VS Code with extensions and settings configured, and an install script for npm and some node libraries.

### Classroom settings

The extensions he likes to have installed:
* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - his favorite! for auto-formatting and linting to help his students find and fix errors in their JavaScript code before running their code
* [TabNine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode) - smarter auto-completions that are AI driven to help his students get full code snippet suggestions
* [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) - for quick manual testing of server calls all within VS Code
* [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur) - Vue.js framework support for syntax highlighting, code completion suggestions and more

These extensions are also part of the Node.js and JS Education Pack below. TODO


And here are his settings, which you can use by editing the [settings file](/docs/getstarted/settings.md) and pasting these in:

```json
{
    // Environment
    "workbench.startupEditor": "newUntitledFile",

    // Formatting & Linting

    "vetur.format.defaultFormatter.js": "prettier", // for consistency with TS option

}
```
