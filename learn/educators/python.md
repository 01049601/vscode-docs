# Python in Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a free, professional-grade, source code editor that fully supports Python and useful features such as real-time collaboration. It's highly customizable to support your classroom the way you like to teach.

> "[Visual Studio Code] is the best balance of authenticity and accessibility. Plus, [Visual Studio Code] works on every OS!" - Professor Zachary Dodds from Harvey Mudd College

Read below for recommendations for extensions, settings, and links to free lessons that you can use in your classes.

## Harvey Mudd College case study

Professor [Zachary Dodds](https://www.hmc.edu/about-hmc/hmc-experts/dodds-zachary/) is a Computer Science professor at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/) who teaches several introductory classes both for students new to Computer Science and students from a non-Computer Science background. He co-created the popular introduction to Computer Science class [CS5](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CS5), which attracts students from all backgrounds to develop programming and problem-solving skills useful in other engineering and mathematical disciplines and to build a "a coherent, intellectually compelling picture of Computer Science". The class is taught with Python and uses Visual Studio Code as the recommended editor.

### Why Visual Studio Code?

Professor Dodds has been recommending and using Visual Studio Code in his classes since Visual Studio Code debuted. "[Visual Studio Code] is the best balance of authenticity and accessibility"; it is a free professional-grade editor used by professional software engineers and students alike. "Plus, [Visual Studio Code] works on every OS": Windows, MacOS, Linux, and even [Chromebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2020/12/03/chromebook-get-started).

### Classroom settings

Since Visual Studio Code is super customizable, Professor Dodds gets his students running a tailored experience for his class that hides suggestive code completions so that they learn from what they type and reinforce the conceptual models being built. Here are the settings his students use to achieve this but you can find the most up-to-date settings on his course website: [CS5 - Python Tips)](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CS5/PythonTips).

```json
"editor.quickSuggestions": false,
"editor.acceptSuggestionOnCommitCharacter": false,
"editor.suggest.filterGraceful": true,
"editor.suggestOnTriggerCharacters": false,
"editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "on",
"editor.suggest.showIcons": false,
"editor.suggest.maxVisibleSuggestions": 7,
"editor.hover.enabled": false,
"editor.hover.sticky": false,
"editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions": false,
"editor.parameterHints.enabled": false,
"editor.wordBasedSuggestions": true,
"editor.tabCompletion": "on",
"extensions.ignoreRecommendations": true,
"files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
```

### Integrated Terminal

Finally, he also utilizes the built-in terminal heavily in his class as an introduction to running programs from the command line and navigating around their machine. He appreciates how "the built-in terminal panel does not try to automate too much (which, if it did, would deprive newcomers of the experience of the information-flow that's going on)."

This student can do all of his CLI needs and code in one place, such as installing Python libraries, as he works on Lab 3 from the CS5 class:
