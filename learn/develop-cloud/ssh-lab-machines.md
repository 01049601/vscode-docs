# Working over SSH

## What is SSH?

SSH, or the secure shell protocol, lets you access a remote computer or virtual machine securely over a network connection.

You can SSH into another machine from VS Code and interact with files and folders anywhere on that remote filesystem. You can also take advantage of any tools or dependencies installed on that remote machine.

## Get started with SSH in VS Code

To get started with using SSH in VS Code, you'll need to download the [Remote - SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) from the Extension Marketplace.

We also highly recommend checking out the step-by-step SSH tutorial.
