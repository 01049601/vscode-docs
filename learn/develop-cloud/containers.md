# Develop with containers

## What are development containers?

Containers are pieces of software that package code and all of the dependencies that code needs to run, including the runtime, tools, libraries, and settings. Dev containers specifically let you code within this piece of software, providing a separate coding environment from your computer.

## Get started with dev containers in VS Code

To get started with using dev containers in VS Code, you'll need to download the [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) from the Extension Marketplace.
