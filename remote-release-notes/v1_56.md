# April 2021 (version 1.56)

## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Local terminal indicator and message

Any _local_ terminal launched within a remote window will now have a special indicator in the dropdown or terminal tab and will also display a warning message to help differentiate them from remote terminals.

## Containers (version 0.174.x)

### Clone repository in container volume now supports to manage the created volumes in a new view

The commands **Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume** and **Remote-Containers: Clone GitHub Pull Request in Container Volume** create a Docker volume for the cloned repository. The Remote Explorer now shows a view **DEVVOLUMES** which supports to inspect and manage these volumes.

From the context menu shown for volumes you can:
- Explore the contents of a volume in a new development container
- Inspect the Docker meta data for a volume
- Remove the volume.

The **DEVVOLUMES** toolbar provides commands to clone a repository in a container volume and to remove unused volumes. Finally, the hover provides additional information about the volume:
- The cloned repository
- The branch name or pull request Id
- The time when the volume was last used
- The containers that are using the volume.

The advanced scenario where multiple repositories are cloned in a single volume is still supported. The command **Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Named Container Volume** allows you to pick an existing or create a new volume for a cloned repository.
