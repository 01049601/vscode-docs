# April 2021 (version 1.56)

## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Local terminal indicator and message

Any **local** terminal launched within a remote window will now have a special indicator in the dropdown or terminal tab and will also display a warning message to help differentiate them from remote terminals.

## Containers (version 0.174.x)

### Clone Repository in Container Volume adds a new management view

The commands **Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume** and **Remote-Containers: Clone GitHub Pull Request in Container Volume** create a Docker volume for the cloned repository. The Remote Explorer now shows a new **DEVVOLUMES** view, where you can inspect and manage these volumes.

From the context menu shown for volumes, you can:

* Explore the contents of a volume in a new development container.
* Inspect the Docker meta data for a volume,
* Remove the volume.

The **DEVVOLUMES** toolbar provides commands to clone a repository in a container volume and to remove unused volumes. In addition, the hover provides additional information about the volume:

* The cloned repository.
* The branch name or pull request ID.
* The time when the volume was last used.
* The containers that are using the volume.

The advanced scenario where multiple repositories are cloned in a single volume is still supported. The command **Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Named Container Volume** allows you to pick an existing or create a new volume for a cloned repository.

### Launch Docker Desktop Installer

On Windows and Mac the extension offers to download and launch the Docker Desktop installer when Docker is not installed yet.
