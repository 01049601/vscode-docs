# November 2021 (version 1.63)

## Containers (version )

## SSH

## WSL

The WSL - Remote extension now uses a new connection method for WSL2 that tackles the reconnection issues that can occur after hibernate and when working on machines with flaky internet connection. It should also help when working behind a proxy.

Instead of using a socket connection to the WSL2 VM address, it uses the `wsl.exe` command to talk to server.

A new setting 'remote.WSL2.connectionMethod' allows you to select the connection method. `wslExeProxy` is the new default. The other options are `wsl2VMAddress` (use a socket connection to the IP of the WSL2 VM) and `localhost` (use a socket connection to `localhost` and let Windows do the proxying).

Please file issues against https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues if the new connection method does not work for you.
