# November 2021 (version 1.63)

## Containers (version )

## SSH

## WSL

The WSL - Remote extension now uses a new connection method for WSL 2 that tackles reconnection issues that can occur after hibernate and when working on machines with flaky internet connections. It should also help when working behind a proxy.

Instead of using a socket connection to the WSL 2 VM address, it uses the `wsl.exe` command to talk to the server.

A new setting `remote.WSL2.connectionMethod` allows you to select the connection method. `wslExeProxy` is the new default. The other options are `wsl2VMAddress` (use a socket connection to the IP of the WSL2 VM) and `localhost` (use a socket connection to `localhost` and let Windows handle the proxy).

Please file issues against [vscode-remote-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues) if the new connection method does not work for you.
