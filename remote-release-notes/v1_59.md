### Rebuild without Cache

A dev container can now be rebuilt without using Docker's image layer cache. When connected to a dev container there is the additional `Rebuild Without Cache` command. When a local folder with a dev container configuration is open there is the additional `Rebuild Without Cache and Reopen in Container` command.

### `devcontainer` CLI

There is now a `devcontainer` Command Line Interface (CLI) that can be installed. This allows you to [open a folder within a dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainer-cli#_opening-a-folder-directly-within-a-dev-container), and to [build the dev container image](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainer-cli#_building-a-dev-container-image) from your terminal.
