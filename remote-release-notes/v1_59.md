### Rebuild without Cache

A dev container can now be rebuilt without using Docker's image layer cache. When connected to a dev container there is the additional `Rebuild Without Cache` command. When a local folder with a dev container configuration is open there is the additional `Rebuild Without Cache and Reopen in Container` command.
