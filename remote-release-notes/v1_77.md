# March 2023 (version 1.77)

## Core

### Install additional built-in extensions via VSIX

VS Code Server now supports installing additional built-in extensions via VSIX. This is useful if the remote setup has VSIX files already available and you want to install them without having to reach out to the Marketplace, thereby improving the startup time. This helped GitHub Codespaces startup to be faster by ~125%.

## Tunnels

When connected to a tunnel in vscode.dev, you can continue in VS Code Desktop with the **Continue Working in VS Code Desktop** command. The command can be found in the remote menu and the Command Palette.

## WSL (version 0.77.x)

The settings `remote.WSL1.connectionMethod` and `remote.WSL2.connectionMethod` have been removed. The WSL extension now always uses the previous default `wslExeProxy`. We are not aware of any problems with that connection method. Please file issues against [vscode-remote-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues) if the new method doesn't work for you.

## Dev Containers

A Dev Container lets you use a container as a full-featured development environment. The [Dev Container Specification](https://containers.dev/) seeks to find ways to enrich existing formats with common development specific settings, tools, and configuration while still providing a simplified, un-orchestrated single container option.

You can learn more about dev containers and their spec in a [new episode of the Changelog podcast](https://changelog.com/podcast/529).
