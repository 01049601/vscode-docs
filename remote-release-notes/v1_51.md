## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Terminal Reconnection

> Note: This is a preliminary release note, and we are still working out the details of this feature

Currently, if you close a Github Codespace, or even if you just reload the tab, any terminal processes that you had running will be shut down. This month, we gave VS Code the ability to persist your terminals and reconnect to them when you reopen the Codespace. Besides Codespaces, this same ability applies to all flavors of VS Code Remote - your terminals will be persisted and reconnected to across sessions.

We try as best we can to only connect to a terminal from one window. If a window disconnects, its terminal sessions are considered "orphaned" and will be kept alive for up to 3 hours. The next client that connects will reconnect to those terminal sessions. In some cases, it is not clear to the server whether a client has disconnected. So when a client may still be connected, the server will ping that client to ask whether it is still using a terminal, with a timeout of 4 seconds.  So it can take up to 4 seconds for a terminal to be adopted by a new client.

### Ports view improvements

The Ports view (formerly the Forwarded Ports view) can be moved into the Panel or another view container. It is no longer confined to the Remote Explorer.

There is also a status bar indicator showing how many ports you currently have forwarded.

When you Run or Debug and a port is printed to the debug console, that port is now automatically forwarded so that you can access your application locally.

When you don't have any forwarded ports we show a welcome view.

Finally, if you have a setup that doesn't work well with automatic port forwarding, you can disable it with the setting `"remote.autoForwardPorts": false`

### Contributing builtin extensions

Introduced a new command line argument `--install-builtin-extension` to install an extension as a builtin extension on server.

- It is shown in Built-in extensions view
- It cannot be uninstalled and can only be enabled/disabled.
- It can be updatable.
