## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Terminal Reconnection

> Note: This is a preliminary release note, and we are still working out the details of this feature

Currently, if you close a Github Codespace, or even if you just reload the tab, any terminal processes that you had running will be shut down. This month, we gave VS Code the ability to persist your terminals and reconnect to them when you reopen the Codespace. Besides Codespaces, this same ability applies to all flavors of VS Code Remote - your terminals will be persisted and reconnected to across sessions.

We try as best we can to only connect to a terminal from one window. If a window disconnects, its terminal sessions are considered "orphaned" and will be kept alive for up to 3 hours. The next client that connects will reconnect to those terminal sessions. In some cases, it is not clear to the server whether a client has disconnected. So when a client may still be connected, the server will ping that client to ask whether it is still using a terminal, with a timeout of 4 seconds.  So it can take up to 4 seconds for a terminal to be adopted by a new client.
