# October 2020 (version 1.51)

## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Terminal Reconnection

> Note: This is a preliminary release note, and we are still working out the details of this feature

Currently, if you reload the browser tab with your Github Codespace in it, any terminal processes that you had running will be shut down. This month, we gave Codespaces the ability to persist your terminals and reconnect to them when you reopen the Codespace. Besides Codespaces, this same ability applies to all flavors of VS Code Remote - your terminals will be persisted and reconnected to when reloading the window.

When a VS Code Remote window closes, your terminal sessions will remain running in the background for some amount of time while we wait for a window to reconnect. The exact amount of time that they will be available for will vary based on a few factors. During this short period of time, the first VS Code window that connects to the remote will reattach to any terminals that were originally started in the same workspace.

You can even reattach manually to terminals from other workspaces that are still running in the background, with the new command `Terminal: Attach to Session`. This will show a list of terminals that are not currently attached to any window. Selecting one will attach it to the current window.

### Ports view improvements

The Ports view (formerly the Forwarded Ports view) can be moved into the Panel or another view container. It is no longer confined to the Remote Explorer.

There is also a status bar indicator showing how many ports you currently have forwarded.

When you Run or Debug and a port is printed to the debug console, that port is now automatically forwarded so that you can access your application locally.

When you don't have any forwarded ports, we show a welcome view.

Finally, if you have a setup that doesn't work well with automatic port forwarding, you can disable it with the setting `"remote.autoForwardPorts": false`

### Contributing built-in extensions

There's a new command line argument `--install-builtin-extension` to install an extension as a built-in extension on server.

* It is shown in the built-in extensions view.
* It cannot be uninstalled and can only be enabled/disabled.
* It can be updatable.
