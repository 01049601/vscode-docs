# January 2021 (version 1.53)

## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Restoring Terminal UI State

In our October 2020 release, we gave VS Code Remote and Codespaces the ability to persist your terminal sessions and reattach to them later, such as after a window reload.

This month, we improved this by adding the ability to restore the UI state of reconnected terminals. This means that split terminals will be restored with the same split dimensions, and the same active terminal will be selected.

### Smart update of machine settings

Machine scoped settings are written into remote settings file when updated through `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().update()` API.

## Containers (version 0.157.x)

### Support SSH connection with password entry

If you connect to Docker using SSH, we now support prompting for a password (and passphrase) when required.
