# January 2021 (version 1.53)

## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Extension management in the remote CLI

The remote CLI in the integrated terminal of remote windows now supports:

- `code --install-extension idOrPathToVSIX` in combination with `--force`
- `code --uninstall-extension idOrPathToVSIX` in combination with `--force`
- `code --list-extensions` in combination with `--show-versions` and `--category`

Note: The commands are restricted to only show and modify only extensions on the remote. To install an extension locally, the local CLI or the extensions viewlet must be used.


### Restoring Terminal UI State

In our October 2020 release, we gave VS Code Remote and Codespaces the ability to persist your terminal sessions and reattach to them later, such as after a window reload.

This month, we improved this by adding the ability to restore the UI state of reconnected terminals. This means that split terminals will be restored with the same split dimensions, and the same active terminal will be selected.

### Smart update of machine settings

Machine scoped settings are written into remote settings file when updated through `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().update()` API.

### Connection Compression

The communication between VS Code and the remote machine is now compressed, using a WebSocket extension called `permessage-deflate`. The compression helps a lot especially with weak network connections.

Here is the data usage when opening a workbench and typing character-for-character the following in an empty TypeScript file:

```ts
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    console.log(`hello world!`);
})
```

| Direction | Data (bytes) | "on the wire" (bytes) | Compression ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| client->server | 1,910,822 | 182,247 | **10.4x** |
| server->client | 619,639 | 80,085 | **7.7x** |

### Less Disruptive Disconnects

Previously, after a short duration of failing to communicate with the remote, a modal dialog would interrupt the user's coding session. We have increased this duration and opted for a subtler indication beforehand.

### Ports Attributes

Attributes can now be configured for ports in settings. These attributes let you control the label that shows in the Ports view, the action that occurs when the port is auto-forwarded, and whether that that port should always prompt for elevation if the local port is privileged (currently no Remote extension support this last one).

### Privileged Port Forwarding

On Linux and MacOS, privileged ports (ports < 1024) could not be detected previously. Now, privileged ports will be detected if a url (ex. http://localhost:80) is printed to the debug console or terminal output and will be auto forwarded.

### More Port Details

The process ID of the process associated with the forwarded port is now shown in the Ports view. You can also see additional details about the forwarded port's CLI when the Ports view is wide.

## Containers (version 0.157.x)

### Support SSH connection with password entry

If you connect to Docker using SSH, we now support prompting for a password (and passphrase) when required.


## WSL

### Install extensions from a WSL shell

The `code` CLI in the WSL shell now also supports
`--list-extensions`, `--uninstall-extension` and `--uninstall-extension`. You can use them to list, remove or add extensions installed on the WSL side. This works for extensions from the Marketplace as well as from VSIXes.

Again, the command is restricted to extensions on the WSL side. To install an extension locally, use `code.cmd` from the Windows side or the extensions view.


### Shortcuts to install WSL and WSL distros

The Remote - WSL extension now guides users how to install WSL and WSL distros when not yet present. It uses the new simplified [`wsl --install`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#simplified-installation-for-windows-insiders) feature available in Windows Preview builds.
