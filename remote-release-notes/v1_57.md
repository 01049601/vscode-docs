# May 2021 (version 1.57)

## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Install Additional Remote Extensions in the Remote Menu

The remote menu now has a command `Install Additional Remote Extensions` that will show all extensions that contributes commands to the remote menu.

If your extensions contributes commands to the remote menu but does not show up, make sure to use the latest version of `vsce` when publishing your extension.

### Multiselect to delete ports

The Ports view supports multiselect to delete multiple forwarded ports.

### Setting a protocol for ports

The `remote.portsAttributes` setting now allows you to set a `protocol` for a forwarded port. The protocol can be `http` or `https` and will be used when that forwarded port is opened in a browser, like with the "Open in Browser" and "Open in Preview" commands.

```json
  "remote.portsAttributes": {
    "3000": {
      "label": "Application",
	  "protocol": "https",
	  "onAutoForward": "openPreview"
	}
  }
```

### Warnings on port collisions

If your development setup requires that you always get the same local port as remote port when a port is forwarded you can now set `requireLocalPort` in the `remote.portsAttributes` setting. This property will cause a modal dialog to show when the matching local port cannot be used for port forwarding.

```json
  "remote.portsAttributes": {
    "3000": {
      "requireLocalPort": true
    }
  }
```

### Port forwarding tunnels are bound to localhost

Previously, all port forwarding tunnels were bound to all-interfaces. Now, all tunnels are bound to localhost. To use all-interfaces instead, change the setting `remote.localPortHost` to `"allInterfaces"`.

## Containers (version 0.182.x)

### Workspace Trust

When opening a folder in a container you are now asked to first trust the local folder. Workspace trust is required because the dev container's configuration is given control over the building of the dev container including access to the host machine. See VS Code 1.57's main release notes for general details about Workspace Trust.

### Environment Probing on Default

Environment variables are now read using an interactive login shell (sourcing, e.g., `~/.profile` and `~/.bashrc`) by default. This should fix many cases where environment variables were missing when executing tasks and launch configurations. The type of shell (login / interactive / Updatenone) can be controlled with the `"userEnvProbe"` property in the devcontainer.json.

### Wait for any user command

The additional `"waitFor"` property in the devcontainer.json can be used to wait for any of the user commands in the devcontainer.json (`"postCreateCommand"`, `"postStartCommand"`, `"postAttachCommand"` and also the new `"onCreateCommand"` and `"updateConentCommand"`) before VS Code connects to the dev container.

Other additional properties include `"onCreateCommand"`, `"updateContentCommand"` and `"hostRequirements"`. These were added for GitHub Codespaces.
