# February 2022 (version 1.65)

## Core

## Containers (version 0.224.x)

### VS Code-specific properties moved under "vscode"

To make the devcontainer.json less VS Code-specific, the `"extensions"`, `"settings"` and `"devPort"` properties have moved under the new `"vscode"` property. The properties in the old locations are still supported.
```json
{
	"name": "Node.js & TypeScript",
	"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/typescript-node:0-16-bullseye",
	"vscode": {
		"extensions": [
			"dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
		]
	}
}
```

## SSH (version 0.76.x)

### Notable fix: connecting to remote machines that have zsh as default shell

A fix was made to the popular issue of connecting to machines using zsh shells. The original issue: [#6341](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/6341)

## WSL (version 0.64.x)
