# November 2020 (version 1.52)

## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Extensions

Introduced a new command **Extensions: Install Remote Extensions Locally...** to install all remote extensions locally.

### Server startup performance

In this milestone, we have done following optimizations to improve startup performance of the server:

- Starting the server and installing the extensions can be done simultaneously now. This will save the waiting time for installing the extensions as they will be installed in the background while the server is being started.

## Containers (version 0.148.x)

### Support to select a branch when opening a repository in a container

When using the **Remote: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone a repository from GitHub, then you can now also select the branch that should be cloned into the volume.
