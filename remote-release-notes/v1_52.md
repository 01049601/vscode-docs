# November 2020 (version 1.52)

## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Extensions

Introduced a new command **Extensions: Install Remote Extensions Locally...** to install all remote extensions locally.

### Server startup performance

In this milestone, we have done following optimizations to improve startup performance of the server:

- Starting the server and installing the extensions can be done simultaneously now. This will save the waiting time for installing the extensions as they will be installed in the background while the server is being started.

## Containers (version 0.153.x)

### Support to select a branch when opening a repository in a container

When using the **Remote: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone a repository from GitHub, then you can now also select the branch that should be cloned into the volume.

### VS Code Server and Extension Cache on Docker volume

We now create a `vscode` Docker volume on which we install the VS Code Server and cache extensions for shorter creation and rebuild times of Dev Containers. Additionally extensions configured in the devcontainer.json and user settings are now installed while the VS Code Server starts up, their installation no longer holds back the startup process.

### Attach to Container in Remote-SSH

You can now attach to an existing container running on an SSH server while you are connected to that SSH server with the Remote-SSH extension. (Note that currently only password-less SSH connections are supported.)
