# November 2020 (version 1.52)

## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Extensions

Introduced a new command **Extensions: Install Remote Extensions Locally...** to install all remote extensions locally.

### Server Startup Performance

In this milestone, we have done following optimizations to improve startup performance of the server:

- You can now start the server and install extensions simultaneously. Extensions will be installed in the background while the server is being started.

## Containers (version 0.148.x)

### Support to select a branch when opening a repository in a container

When using the **Remote: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone a repository from GitHub, then you can now also select the branch that should be cloned into the volume.
