## Extension naming (WSL and Dev Containers)

We've heard your feedback about the naming of the **Remote-WSL** and **Remote-Containers** extensions. We intended for `Remote` in their names to indicate you develop in a "remote" or "separate" WSL distro or development container, rather than traditional local development. However, this is a different use of "remote" than many people use, and it could lead to confusion (i.e. is the dev container on my machine?).

Thus, we've updated naming and in-product commands in these extensions to be clearer, renaming them to the [`WSL` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) and the [`Dev Containers` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). Links such as the extension identifier in the marketplace and documentation remain the same, so you shouldn't see breakage in your current use of these two extensions.
