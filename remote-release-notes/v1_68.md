## Development Container Specification

Our development container teams across Microsoft and GitHub continue active development on the new [Dev Container Specification](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec), and this iteration had several exciting highlights.

### Reference Implementation

We released an open source command-line interface (CLI) as the reference implementation for the specification. The CLI builds and starts a dev container from a `devcontainer.json`, and it can either be used directly or integrated into product experiences.

The CLI is available in a new [devcontainers/cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) repository. You can learn how to get started in [its readme](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli#try-it-out), and read more in [this blog post](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/05/18/dev-container-cli).

The CLI is under active development and will continue evolving to better support more scenarios, such as greater support for individual users. We'd love to hear your feedback along the way, so we've [opened an issue](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli/issues/7) specifically for feedback on the CLI and welcome additional issues and PRs in the repo.

### Specification

Active development continues on the specification, and we've published an [initial version](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/blob/main/docs/specs/devcontainer-reference.md) in the [devcontainers/spec](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec) repo.

As with the CLI, stay tuned for further updates and progress, and we'd love to hear your feedback.
