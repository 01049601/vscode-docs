# June 2021 (version 1.58)

## Containers (version 0.187.x)

### devcontainer.json support for `--cacheFrom`

When using a Dockerfile you can now specify one or more images to use as caches when building the image. These are passed to the `docker build` command with `--cacheFrom`.

```json
{
  ...

  "build": {
    "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
    "cacheFrom": "<image identifier>"
  }
}
```

[Stuart Leeks (@stuartleeks)](https://github.com/stuartleeks) contributed this option as a PR.

### Host Requirements

Remote-Containers now checks if the `"hostRequirements"` in the devcontainer.json are met by the Docker daemon's host machine:

```json
{
  ...

  "hostRequirements": {
    "memory": "10gb",
    "storage": "20gb",
    "cpus": 3
  }
}
```

### Update UID/GID with Docker Compose on Linux

We now update UID/GID of the container user also when using Docker Compose. This was previously only available when using a single container. It can be turned off with `"updateRemoteUserUID": false` in the devcontainer.json.

### `"overrideCommand"` support with Docker Compose

We now support overriding the command and entrypoint with Docker Compose. The default with Docker Compose is to not override. This can be turned on with `"overrideCommand": true` in the devcontainer.json.
