## Dev Containers

### Create Configuration from Published Templates and Features

When adding a dev container configuration (`F1` > `Dev Containers: Add Dev Container Configuration Files...`) you can select from the list of published templates and features. Previously only built-in templates and features were available.

See [Development Container Templates](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates) and [Development Container Features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features) for more information about the publishing of templates and features.

### Create Dev Container Without Local Folder

You can now create a dev container in an empty Docker volume (`F1` > `Dev Containers: Create Dev Container...`) based on a dev container template and features.

### Feature Environment Variables

Dev container feature scripts have now access to the remote and container users (corresponding to the `"remoteUser"` and `"containerUser"` properties in the devcontainer.json) and their home folders through the environment variables `_REMOTE_USER`, `_REMOTE_USER_HOME`, `_CONTAINER_USER` and `_CONTAINER_USER_HOME`.

See [Development Container Features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features) for more information about writing your own features.

### Dev Container ID Variable

The `devcontainer.json` and `devcontainer-feature.json` now support the `${devcontainerId}` variable that is replaced with unique identifier for the dev container. This can, e.g., be used for a feature to mount a unique volume for the dev container:
```json
{
    "id": "docker-in-docker",
    "version": "1.0.4",
    // ...
    "mounts": [
        {
            "source": "dind-var-lib-docker-${devcontainerId}",
            "target": "/var/lib/docker",
            "type": "volume"
        }
    ]
}
```

See the [Dev Container ID proposal](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/blob/0ba05dda33eaa11fd1dfb93ccc09665b4ce7ac00/proposals/devcontainer-id-variable.md) for the details.
