# March 2022 (version 1.66)

## Core

## Containers (version 0.224.x)

You may now add a badge or link to your repository so that users can easily open your project in Remote - Containers. It will install the Remote - Containers extension if necessary, clone the repo into a container [volume](/remote/advancedcontainers/improve-performance.md#use-clone-repository-in-container-volume), and start up the dev container.

As an example, a badge to open https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-java would look like: [![Open in Remote - Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-java)

You may also include an [open in dev container](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-java) link directly.

## SSH (version 0.78.x)

You can now connect to remote Apple Silicon/M1/ARM64 machines with the Remote SSH extension. 

## WSL (version 0.64.x)
