## Core

## Development Containers

We continue work across the Remote-Containers extension and the open [dev container specification](https://containers.dev/), which seeks to allow anyone in any tool (including ones other than VS Code) to use containers for their inner and outer loop activities. Its reference implementation is the [dev container CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli).

### Remote-Containers

We [introduced a fix](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli/issues/83) so that copying a file with executable permissions (such as the dev container CLI executable) preserves the executable bit on the file permissions.

### Dev container specification

We've merged an [updated proposal for distributing features and templates](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/blob/main/proposals/devcontainer-features-distribution.md), now with the ability to upload them as [OCI Artifacts in registries](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/blob/main/proposals/devcontainer-features-distribution.md#oci-registry). We are working toward getting this into the CLI and welcome any feedback on the proposal via GitHub [issues](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/discussions).

### Dev container CLI

Dev container "Features" are self-contained units of installation code and development container configuration. The dev container CLI was [updated to support the latest in Features](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli/pull/73), aka "Features v2."

The CLI [now supports](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli/pull/61) multiple `--image-name` parameters, such as: `devcontainer build --workspace-folder ./ --image-name alpine3 --image-name alpine3.0`. This allows you to tag the same image more than once, which is especially helpful for tagging multi-architecture images.

We've added the ability to [test features](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli/pull/81) from the CLI with `devcontainer features test`. Below is an example of this command:

There was also a [bug fix](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/6913) to allow falling back to `id -u -n` in the case the container can't find a username.

## SSH

## WSL

## The Visual Studio Code Server (private preview)

### Connect in VS Code for Desktop

With the VS Code Server and its port forwarding service, you can connect to any remote machine within VS Code for Web (vscode.dev). You can read more about it in the [announcement blog post](https://aka.ms/vscode-server-blog).

Now we've enabled connecting to any remote machine on both the Web and Desktop versions of VS Code with the Remote Server extension (you can find the extension by searching for `ms-vscode.remote-server` in the Extensions view). This means you can connect to any remote machine on any platform of VS Code without needing SSH.

To learn more about how to get started with the VS Code Server in its [documentation](https://aka.ms/vscode-server-doc).
