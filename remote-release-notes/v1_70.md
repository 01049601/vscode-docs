## The Visual Studio Code Server (private preview)

### Connect in VS Code for Desktop

With the VS Code Server and its port forwarding service, we enabled you to connect to any remote machine within VS Code for Web (vscode.dev). You can read more about it in its [announcement blog post](https://aka.ms/vscode-server-blog).

Now we've enabled connecting to any remote machine on both the Web and Desktop versions of VS Code with the Remote Server extension (found by searching for `ms-vscode.remote-server` in the Extension marketplace). This means you can connect to any remote machine on any platform of VS Code without needing SSH.

To learn more about how to get started with the VS Code Server in its [documentation](https://aka.ms/vscode-server-doc).
