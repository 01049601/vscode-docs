# January 2022 (version 1.64)

## Core

## Containers (version 0.216.x)

### Always run feature entrypoints

Container features can now run their own entrypoint, e.g., to start a daemon process like `sshd`, also when you choose to not override your container's entrypoint (`"overrideCommand": false` in the devcontainer.json, which is the default for Docker Compose).

### Container definition documentation links

Container definitions now have an inline action to open documentation on the definition in the browser.

### Pre-release versions

The Remote-Containers extension is now using the pre-release feature for extensions, making it simple to switch between release and pre-release versions.

### Development container specification repo

To provide a common ground for all editors and IDEs to support devcontainer.json, and to support editor-specific dev container property-bags beyond VS Code, we created https://github.com/microsoft/dev-container-spec. Here you can open and review issues to help shape the direction of development containers and the dev container CLI.

## SSH (version 0.72.x)

### Pre-release version

The Remote-SSH extension has adopted the pre-release extension model to allow anyone to switch between using the stable release of the extension, that is released along with every stable release of VS Code, and the pre-release version of the extension that is released everyday with the most up-to-date features and fixes.

### Enable RemoteCommand

You can now use RemoteCommands defined in your SSH Configuration entries. With the settings `remote.SSH.useLocalServer` and `remote.SSH.enableRemoteCommand` set to `true`. Note: only commands that don't close the shell will work properly. If you try the same connection with your shell and you see the command executes on the remote and then the connection immediately closes, that command will not work with the Remote-SSH extension. Only commands that leave the SSH connection in an interactive state will work as expected.

## WSL (version 0.64.x)

The Remote-WSL extension now also supports Alpine distros running on arm64 .
