# September 2020 (version 1.50)

## Visual Studio Code Remote Core


## SSH


## Containers

### Improved Log Access and Rendering

When you open a folder locally after opening it in a container failed, the new command `Remote-Containers: Show Previous Log` opens the log from the failed attempt to open in a container.

The command `Remote-Containers Developer: Show All Logs...` now shows one file per startup (instead of one file per VS Code session potentially spanning several startups) making it easier to navigate:

The current log shown in the DevContainer terminal with the `Remote-Containers: Show Log` command now comes with coloring:

### DevContainer Development Actions in Remote-Explorer

The Remote-Explorer viewlet's Details section now comes with the `Open Container Configuration File` and `Rebuild Container` actions which previously were only available in the command palette:

### Clone Repository in Container Volume: better recovery support

When opening a repository in a container volume using `Clone Repository in Container Volume` fails, then we now show the creation log of the container together with the `devcontainer.json` in the recovery container. This is now the same experience as when `Open Folder in Container` fails.

### Notable Fixes

- [3648](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/3648): `Pass "remoteEnv" variables to "postCreate/Start/AttachCommand"s and dotfiles script.`

## WSL

### Inherit environment from process where `code .` is executed

The remote WSL window now inherits environment from the WSL shell where `code .` is executed.
