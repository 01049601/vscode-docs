# March 2021 (version 1.55)

## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Consolidation or local and remote terminal process architecture

Last month for terminal processes in local windows started launching in a new isolated process called the "pty host", isolating the important main process from potential native crashes and freeing up cycles in its important event loop. This release sees these changes come to remote terminals as well, sharing the majority of their implementation and bringing the hardening benefits of the pty host to remote.

This also saw the departure of the `terminal.integrated.serverSpawn` and `terminal.integrated.flowControl` settings which are now stable and always on.

### Commands keybinding changes in browsers

Due to overlap with existing browser keybindings, we have changed the following commands:

* **Step Over** is now using `Alt + F10` instead of `F10` on all browsers.
* **Step Into** is now using `Alt + F11` instead of `F11` on Windows browsers.

## Containers (version 0.166.x)

### Clone Repository in Container Volume improvements

* There is a new command **Remote-Containers: Clone GitHub Pull Request in Container Volume**. You could already clone a GitHub pull request in a container volume when using the URL of the pull request with the **Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume** command. Having a separate command makes the feature more discoverable.

* The command **Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume** now also understands ADO and GitLab repository URLs.

### Optional install command for dotfiles repository

If a dotfiles repository has no install command, we now link all top-level dotfiles into the home folder. We consider additional filenames when looking for an install command: `install.sh`, `install`, `bootstrap.sh`, `bootstrap`, `setup.sh` and `setup`.

### Portable `"initializeCommand"`

When using the array syntax for `"initializeCommand"`, the command element can use a relativ path with slashes as delimiters to be portable between Windows, Mac and Linux. On Mac and Linux the path will be used as-is. On Windows the slashes will be replaced with backslashes and an executable will be searched for by appending Windows' executable file extensions.
