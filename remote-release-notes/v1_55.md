## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Consolidation or local and remote terminal process architecture

Last month for terminal processes in local windows started launching in a new isolated process called the "pty host", isolating the important main process from potential native crashes and freeing up cycles in its important event loop. This release sees these changes come to remote terminals as well, sharing the majority of their implementation and bringing the hardening benefits of the pty host to remote.

This also saw the departure of the `terminal.integrated.serverSpawn` and `terminal.integrated.flowControl` settings which are now stable and always on.

### Commands keybinding changes in browsers

Due to overlap with existing browser keybindings we have changed the following commands:
* `Step Over` is now using `Alt + F10` instead of `F10` on all browsers
* `Step Into` is now using `Alt + F11` instead of `F11` on Windows browsers
