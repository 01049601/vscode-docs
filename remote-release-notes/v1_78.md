## Core

### Hybrid port source

The new `"hybrid"` value for the setting `"remote.autoForwardPortsSource"` will discover ports by watching terminal and debug output, in the same way that the existing `"output"` setting value does. However, process watching is still used so that when a process that listens on a port exits, the port is no longer forwarded. This allows you to narrow the number of ports discovered for forwarding while still getting the additional features of process based port forwarding.
