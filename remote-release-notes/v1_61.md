## Core

### Port protocol for 443 and 8443 defaults to https

Since ports 443 and 8443 are often https, VS Code will now default them to use https. This can be overridden with the `"remote.portsAttributes"` setting if the new behavior is not wanted.

### DNS names in forwarded ports

DNS names can now be specified when forwarding a port. For example, if you have a MongoDB database available at `db:1234` on your remote, you can enter `"db:1234"` in the "Ports" view and your remote `db:1234` will be available locally at `localhost:1234`. For remotes with a `devcontainer.json`, you can also specify the DNS name in `forwardPorts`:

```json
{
    "forwardPorts": [ "db:5432" ]
}
```

Forwarded ports that include a non-localhost DNS name show the name in the "Ports" view:
