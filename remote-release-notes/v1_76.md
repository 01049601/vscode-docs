### Note on Bind Mount Performance

On Windows and Mac we have added a note to the details of bind mounts because these cross OS boundaries (Linux <> Windows/Mac) and that can be slow on large folders.

To avoid this performance penalty on Windows you could use a folder in WSL. On both OSes, Mac and Windows, you could use the `F1` > `Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...` command to clone a repository into a Docker volume which also uses a Linux filesystem and avoids bridging OSes.

### Deprecated Legacy Container Features

Container features listed under `"features"` in the `devcontainer.json` were initially built-in and we have since moved on to a model where these can be contributed by the community in OSI registries in a decentralized way and updated on-demand. See the [documentation](https://containers.dev/implementors/features) for more details on the current contribution model.

For most of the legacy features we have introduced a corresponding replacement in the current set of features provided by us and these will continue to work into the future. Five of the legacy features have not been replaced by us because they are either beyond the scope of what we can provide or we have folded them into other features. These five legacy features are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

The deprecated legacy features are:
- `fish`: Check the list of [available features](https://containers.dev/features) for replacements.
- `maven`: `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/java` has an option to install Maven.
- `gradle`: `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/java` has an option to install Gradle.
- `homebrew`: Check the list of [available features](https://containers.dev/features) for replacements.
- `jupyterlab`: `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python` has an option to install JupyterLab.
