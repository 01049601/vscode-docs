### Sort Folders in Remote Explorer Alphabetically

A new setting is added to Remote - SSH: `remote.SSH.foldersSortOrder` which allows you to sort your folders under the targets in the SSH Remote Explorer either alphabetically or in order of most recently opened.

## WSL

In the hover over the remote indicator we now show whether the current distro is a WSL1 or WSL2 distro:

Additionally, the distro pickers and the remote explorer put a label behind the WSL1 distros:

We recommend to use WSL2 for the better performance.
