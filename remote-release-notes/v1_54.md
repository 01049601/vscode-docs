### Use polling for Windows file system mount in WSL2

n WSL you can access the Windows file system through a mount: `/mnt/...`.
However, in WSL 2 distros, the mount has [known issues with file events](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/).

To work around that, we now use polling for all folders opened on a Windows file system.
That's controlled by a setting `remote.WSL.fileWatcher.polling` which is now true by default

### Recommend using WSL2 Linux file system

Working with a WSL 2 distro on the Windows file system is far less performant than on the Linux file system (e.g. /home/..).

We now show a notification when the user opens a folder on a Windows file system mount and recommend to better use the Linux file system. More information on this topic can also be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions#performance-across-os-file-systems


### Fix for WSL2 connection issues when behind a proxy

When we connect to the VSCode server running in WSL2, we directly use the WSL2 VM's IP.

Due to a change in 1.53, this no longer worked for users that have proxy settings defined. To fix this, we now try to detect that the IP can not be reached and use `localhost` instead.
If the detection doesn't work or takes too long: you can force the use of `localhost` with the setting `remote.WSL.server.connectThroughLocalhost`.
